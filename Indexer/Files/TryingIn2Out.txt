(About

is
a
Semitic
language
that
first
emerged
in
the
1st
to
4th
centuries
CE.[3]
It
is
now
the
lingua
franca
of
the
Arab
world.[4]
It
is
named
after
the
Arabs
a
term
initially
used
to
describe
peoples
living
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
bounded
by
eastern
Egypt
in
the
west
Mesopotamia
in
the
east
and
the
Anti-Lebanon
mountains
and
Northern
Syria
in
the
north
as
perceived
by
ancient
Greek
geographers[5]
The
ISO
assigns
language
codes
to
thirty
varieties
of
Arabic
including
its
standard
form
Modern
Standard
Arabic[6]
also
referred
to
as
Literary
Arabic
which
is
modernized
Classical
Arabic.
This
distinction
exists
primarily
among
Western
linguists;
Arabic
speakers
themselves
generally
do
not
distinguish
between
Modern
Standard
Arabic
and
Classical
Arabic
but
rather
refer
to
both
as
al-ʿarabiyyatu
l-fuṣḥā
(اَلعَرَبِيَّةُ
ٱلْفُصْحَىٰ[7]
the
eloquent
Arabic)
or
simply
al-fuṣḥā
(اَلْفُصْحَىٰ).
Modern
Standard
Arabic
is
an
official
language
of
26
states
and
1
disputed
territory
the
third
most
after
English
and
French.[8]

Arabic
is
widely
taught
in
schools
and
universities
and
is
used
to
varying
degrees
in
workplaces
government
and
the
media.
Arabic
in
its
standard
form
is
the
official
language
of
26
states
as
well
as
the
liturgical
language
of
the
religion
of
Islam
since
the
Quran
and
Hadith
were
written
in
Arabic.

During
the
Middle
Ages
Arabic
was
a
major
vehicle
of
culture
in
Europe
especially
in
science
mathematics
and
philosophy.
As
a
result
many
European
languages
have
also
borrowed
many
words
from
it.
Arabic
influence
mainly
in
vocabulary
is
seen
in
European
languages—mainly
Spanish
and
to
a
lesser
extent
Portuguese
Catalan
and
Sicilian—owing
to
both
the
proximity
of
Christian
European
and
Muslim
Arab
civilizations
and
the
long-lasting
Arabic
culture
and
language
presence
mainly
in
Southern
Iberia
during
the
Al-Andalus
era.
The
Maltese
language
is
a
Semitic
language
developed
from
a
dialect
of
Arabic
and
written
in
the
Latin
alphabet.[9]
The
Balkan
languages
including
Greek
and
Bulgarian
have
also
acquired
a
significant
number
of
Arabic
words
through
contact
with
Ottoman
Turkish.

Arabic
has
influenced
many
other
languages
around
the
globe
throughout
its
history.
Some
of
the
most
influenced
languages
are
Persian
Turkish
Hindustani
(Hindi
and
Urdu)[10]
Kashmiri
Kurdish
Bosnian
Kazakh
Bengali
Malay
(Indonesian
and
Malaysian)
Maldivian
Pashto
Punjabi
Albanian
Armenian
Azerbaijani
Sicilian
Spanish
Greek
Bulgarian
Tagalog
Sindhi
Odia[11]
and
Hausa
and
some
languages
in
parts
of
Africa.
Conversely
Arabic
has
borrowed
words
from
other
languages
including
Hebrew
Greek
Aramaic
and
Persian
in
medieval
times
and
languages
such
as
English
and
French
in
modern
times.

Arabic
is
the
liturgical
language
of
1.8
billion
Muslims
and
Arabic[12]
is
one
of
six
official
languages
of
the
United
Nations.[13][14][15][16]
All
varieties
of
Arabic
combined
are
spoken
by
perhaps
as
many
as
422
million
speakers
(native
and
non-native)
in
the
Arab
world[17]
making
it
the
fifth
most
spoken
language
in
the
world.
Arabic
is
written
with
the
Arabic
alphabet
which
is
an
abjad
script
and
is
written
from
right
to
left
although
the
spoken
varieties
are
sometimes
written
in
ASCII
Latin
from
left
to
right
with
no
standardized
orthography.

Classification
of
Arabic

Arabic
is
usually
but
not
universally
classified
as
a
Central

language.

in
other
subgroups
of
the
Semitic
language
group
(Northwest

Linguists
still
differ
as
to
the
best
classification
of
Semitic
language
sub-groups.[3]
The
Semitic
languages
changed
a
great
deal
between
Proto-Semitic
and
the
emergence
of
the
Central
Semitic
languages
particularly
in
grammar.
Innovations
of
the
Central
Semitic
languages—all
maintained
in
Arabic—include:

The
conversion
of
the
suffix-conjugated
stative
formation
(jalas-)
into
a
past
tense.
The
conversion
of
the
prefix-conjugated
preterite-tense
formation
(yajlis-)
into
a
present
tense.
The
elimination
of
other
prefix-conjugated
mood/aspect
forms
(e.g.
a
present
tense
formed
by
doubling
the
middle
root
a
perfect
formed
by
infixing
a
/t/
after
the
first
root
consonant
probably
a
jussive
formed
by
a
stress
shift)
in
favor
of
new
moods
formed
by
endings
attached
to
the
prefix-conjugation
forms
(e.g.
-u
for
indicative
-a
for
subjunctive
no
ending
for
jussive
-an
or
-anna
for
energetic).
The
development
of
an
internal
passive.
There
are
several
features
which
Classical
Arabic
the
modern
Arabic
varieties
as
well
as
the
Safaitic
and
Hismaic
inscriptions
share
which
are
unattested
in
any
other
Central
Semitic
language
variety
including
the
Dadanitic
and
Taymanitic
languages
of
the
northern
Hejaz.
These
features
are
evidence
of
common
descent
from
a
hypothetical
ancestor
Proto-Arabic.

History
Old
Arabic
Main
article:
Old
Arabic

Safaitic
inscription
Arabia
boasted
a
wide
variety
of
Semitic
languages
in
antiquity.
In
the
southwest
various
Central
Semitic
languages
both
belonging
to
and
outside
of
the
Ancient
South
Arabian
family
(e.g.
Southern
Thamudic)
were
spoken.
It
is
also
believed
that
the
ancestors
of
the
Modern
South
Arabian
languages
(non-Central
Semitic
languages)
were
also
spoken
in
southern
Arabia
at
this
time.
To
the
north
in
the
oases
of
northern
Hejaz
Dadanitic
and
Taymanitic
held
some
prestige
as
inscriptional
languages.
In
Najd
and
parts
of
western
Arabia
a
language
known
to
scholars
as
Thamudic
C
is
attested.
In
eastern
Arabia
inscriptions
in
a
script
derived
from
ASA
attest
to
a
language
known
as
Hasaitic.
Finally
on
the
northwestern
frontier
of
Arabia
various
languages
known
to
scholars
as
Thamudic
B
Thamudic
D
Safaitic
and
Hismaic
are
attested.
The
last
two
share
important
isoglosses
with
later
forms
of
Arabic
leading
scholars
to
theorize
that
Safaitic
and
Hismaic
are
in
fact
early
forms
of
Arabic
and
that
they
should
be
considered
Old
Arabic.[19]

Linguists
generally
believe
that
Old
Arabic
(a
collection
of
related
dialects
that
constitute
the
precursor
of
Arabic)
first
emerged
around
the
1st
century
CE.
Previously
the
earliest
attestation
of
Old
Arabic
was
thought
to
be
a
single
1st
century
CE
inscription
in
Sabaic
script
at
Qaryat
Al-Faw
in
southern
present-day
Saudi
Arabia.
However
this
inscription
does
not
participate
in
several
of
the
key
innovations
of
the
Arabic
language
group
such
as
the
conversion
of
Semitic
mimation
to
nunation
in
the
singular.
It
is
best
reassessed
as
a
separate
language
on
the
Central
Semitic
dialect
continuum.[20]

It
was
also
thought
that
Old
Arabic
coexisted
alongside—and
then
gradually
displaced--epigraphic
Ancient
North
Arabian
(ANA)
which
was
theorized
to
have
been
the
regional
tongue
for
many
centuries.
ANA
despite
its
name
was
considered
a
very
distinct
language
and
mutually
unintelligible
from
Arabic.
Scholars
named
its
variant
dialects
after
the
towns
where
the
inscriptions
were
discovered
(Dadanitic
Taymanitic
Hismaic
Safaitic).[3]
However
most
arguments
for
a
single
ANA
language
or
language
family
were
based
on
the
shape
of
the
definite
article
a
prefixed
h-.
It
has
been
argued
that
the
h-
is
an
archaism
and
not
a
shared
innovation
and
thus
unsuitable
for
language
classification
rendering
the
hypothesis
of
an
ANA
language
family
untenable.[21]
Safaitic
and
Hismaic
previously
considered
ANA
should
be
considered
Old
Arabic
due
to
the
fact
that
they
participate
in
the
innovations
common
to
all
forms
of
Arabic.[19]


The
Namara
inscription
a
sample
of
Nabataean
script
considered
a
direct
precursor
of
Arabic
script.[22][23]
The
earliest
attestation
of
continuous
Arabic
text
in
an
ancestor
of
the
modern
Arabic
script
are
three
lines
of
poetry
by
a
man
named
Garm()allāhe
found
in
En
Avdat
Israel
and
dated
to
around
125
CE.[24]
This
is
followed
by
the
Namara
inscription
an
epitaph
of
the
Lakhmid
king
Mar
al-Qays
bar
Amro
dating
to
328
CE
found
at
Namaraa
Syria.
From
the
4th
to
the
6th
centuries
the
Nabataean
script
evolves
into
the
Arabic
script
recognizable
from
the
early
Islamic
era.[25]
There
are
inscriptions
in
an
undotted
17-letter
Arabic
script
dating
to
the
6th
century
CE
found
at
four
locations
in
Syria
(Zabad
Jabal
Usays
Harran
Umm
al-Jimaal).
The
oldest
surviving
papyrus
in
Arabic
dates
to
643
CE
and
it
uses
dots
to
produce
the
modern
28-letter
Arabic
alphabet.
The
language
of
that
papyrus
and
of
the
Quran
are
referred
to
by
linguists
as
Quranic
Arabic
as
distinct
from
its
codification
soon
thereafter
into
Classical
Arabic.[3]

Arabic
from
the
Quran
in
the
old
Hijazi
dialect
(Hijazi
script
7th
century
AD)
In
late
pre-Islamic
times
a
transdialectal
and
transcommunal
variety
of
Arabic
emerged
in
the
Hejaz
which
continued
living
its
parallel
life
after
literary
Arabic
had
been
institutionally
standardized
in
the
2nd
and
3rd
century
of
the
Hijra
most
strongly
in
Judeo-Christian
texts
keeping
alive
ancient
features
eliminated
from
the
learned
tradition
(Classical
Arabic).[26]
This
variety
and
both
its
classicizing
and
lay
iterations
have
been
termed
Middle
Arabic
in
the
past
but
they
are
thought
to
continue
an
Old
Higazi
register.
It
is
clear
that
the
orthography
of
the
Quran
was
not
developed
for
the
standardized
form
of
Classical
Arabic;
rather
it
shows
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
writers
to
record
an
archaic
form
of
Old
Higazi.


The
Quran
has
served
and
continues
to
serve
as
a
fundamental
reference
for
Arabic.
(Maghrebi
Kufic
script
Blue
Quran
9th-10th
century)
In
the
late
6th
century
AD
a
relatively
uniform
intertribal
poetic
koine
distinct
from
the
spoken
vernaculars
developed
based
on
the
Bedouin
dialects
of
Najd
probably
in
connection
with
the
court
of
al-Ḥīra.
During
the
first
Islamic
century
the
majority
of
Arabic
poets
and
Arabic-writing
persons
spoke
Arabic
as
their
mother
tongue.
Their
texts
although
mainly
preserved
in
far
later
manuscripts
contain
traces
of
non-standardized
Classical
Arabic
elements
in
morphology
and
syntax.

Following
the
early
Muslim
conquests
Arabic
gained
vocabulary
from
Middle
Persian
and
Turkish.[22]
In
the
early
Abbasid
period
many
Classical
Greek
terms
entered
Arabic
through
translations
carried
out
at
Baghdads
House
of
Wisdom.[22]

The
standardization
of
Classical
Arabic
reached
completion
around
the
end
of
the
8th
century.
The
first
comprehensive
description
of
the
ʿarabiyya
Arabic
Sībawayhis
al-Kitāb
is
based
first
of
all
upon
a
corpus
of
poetic
texts
in
addition
to
Quran
usage
and
Bedouin
informants
whom
he
considered
to
be
reliable
speakers
of
the
ʿarabiyya.[27]
By
the
8th
century
knowledge
of
Classical
Arabic
had
become
an
essential
prerequisite
for
rising
into
the
higher
classes
throughout
the
Islamic
world.

Neo-Arabic
Charles
Fergusons
koine
theory
(Ferguson
1959)
claims
that
the
modern
Arabic
dialects
collectively
descend
from
a
single
military
koine
that
sprang
up
during
the
Islamic
conquests;
this
view
has
been
challenged
in
recent
times.
Ahmad
al-Jallad
proposes
that
there
were
at
least
two
considerably
distinct
types
of
Arabic
on
the
eve
of
the
conquests:
Northern
and
Central
(Al-Jallad
2009).
The
modern
dialects
emerged
from
a
new
contact
situation
produced
following
the
conquests.
Instead
of
the
emergence
of
a
single
or
multiple
koines
the
dialects
contain
several
sedimentary
layers
of
borrowed
and
areal
features
which
they
absorbed
at
different
points
in
their
linguistic
histories.[27]
According
to
Veersteegh
and
Bickerton
colloquial
Arabic
dialects
arose
from
pidginized
Arabic
formed
from
contact
between
Arabs
and
conquered
peoples.
Pidginization
and
subsequent
creolization
among
Arabs
and
arabized
peoples
could
explain
relative
morphological
and
phonological
simplicity
of
vernacular
Arabic
compared
to
Classical
and
MSA.[28][29]

In
around
the
11th
and
12th
centuries
in
al-Andalus
the
zajal
and
muwashah
poetry
forms
developed
in
the
dialectical
Arabic
of
Cordoba
and
the
Maghreb.[30]

Nahda

Taha
Hussein
and
Gamal
Abdel
Nasser
were
both
staunch
defenders
of
Standard
Arabic.[31][32]
In
the
wake
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
European
hegemony
and
colonialism
pioneering
Arabic
presses
such
as
the
Amiri
Press
established
by
Muhammad
Ali
(1819)
dramatically
changed
the
diffusion
and
consumption
of
Arabic
literature
and
publications.[33]

The
Nahda
cultural
renaissance
saw
the
creation
of
a
number
of
Arabic
academies
modeled
after
the
Académie
française
that
aimed
to
develop
the
Arabic
lexicon
to
suit
these
transformations[34]
first
in
Damascus
(1919)
then
in
Cairo
(1932)
Baghdad
(1948)
Rabat
(1960)
Amman
(1977)
Khartum
[ar]
(1993)
and
Tunis
(1993).[35]
In
1997
a
bureau
of
Arabization
standardization
was
added
to
the
Educational
Cultural
and
Scientific
Organization
of
the
Arab
League.[35]
These
academies
and
organizations
have
worked
toward
the
Arabization
of
the
sciences
creating
terms
in
Arabic
to
describe
new
concepts
toward
the
standardization
of
these
new
terms
throughout
the
Arabic-speaking
world
and
toward
the
development
of
Arabic
as
a
world
language.[35]
This
gave
rise
to
what
Western
scholars
call
Modern
Standard
Arabic.

From
the
1950s
Arabization
became
a
postcolonial
nationalist
policy
in
countries
such
as
Tunisia
Algeria
Morocco[36]
and
Sudan.[37]

Arabic
usually
refers
to
Standard
Arabic
which
Western
linguists
divide
into
Classical
Arabic
and
Modern
Standard
Arabic.[38]
It
could
also
refer
to
any
of
a
variety
of
regional
vernacular
Arabic
dialects
which
are
not
necessarily
mutually
intelligible.

Classical
Arabic
is
the
language
found
in
the
Quran
used
from
the
period
of
Pre-Islamic
Arabia
to
that
of
the
Abbasid
Caliphate.
Classical
Arabic
is
prescriptive
according
to
the
syntactic
and
grammatical
norms
laid
down
by
classical
grammarians
(such
as
Sibawayh)
and
the
vocabulary
defined
in
classical
dictionaries
(such
as
the
Lisān
al-ʻArab).

Modern
Standard
Arabic
largely
follows
the
grammatical
standards
of
Classical
Arabic
and
uses
much
of
the
same
vocabulary.
However
it
has
discarded
some
grammatical
constructions
and
vocabulary
that
no
longer
have
any
counterpart
in
the
spoken
varieties
and
has
adopted
certain
new
constructions
and
vocabulary
from
the
spoken
varieties.
Much
of
the
new
vocabulary
is
used
to
denote
concepts
that
have
arisen
in
the
industrial
and
post-industrial
era
especially
in
modern
times.
Due
to
its
grounding
in
Classical
Arabic
Modern
Standard
Arabic
is
removed
over
a
millennium
from
everyday
speech
which
is
construed
as
a
multitude
of
dialects
of
this
language.
These
dialects
and
Modern
Standard
Arabic
are
described
by
some
scholars
as
not
mutually
comprehensible.
The
former
are
usually
acquired
in
families
while
the
latter
is
taught
in
formal
education
settings.
However
there
have
been
studies
reporting
some
degree
of
comprehension
of
stories
told
in
the
standard
variety
among
preschool-aged
children.[39]
The
relation
between
Modern
Standard
Arabic
and
these
dialects
is
sometimes
compared
to
that
of
Classical
Latin
and
Vulgar
Latin
vernaculars
(which
became
Romance
languages)
in
medieval
and
early
modern
Europe.[40]
This
view
though
does
not
take
into
account
the
widespread
use
of
Modern
Standard
Arabic
as
a
medium
of
audiovisual
communication
in
todays
mass
media—a
function
Latin
has
never
performed.

MSA
is
the
variety
used
in
most
current
printed
Arabic
publications
spoken
by
some
of
the
Arabic
media
across
North
Africa
and
the
Middle
East
and
understood
by
most
educated
Arabic
speakers.
Literary
Arabic
and
Standard
Arabic
(فُصْحَى‎
fuṣḥá)
are
less
strictly
defined
terms
that
may
refer
to
Modern
Standard
Arabic
or
Classical
Arabic.

Some
of
the
differences
between
Classical
Arabic
(CA)
and
Modern
Standard
Arabic
(MSA)
are
as
follows:

Certain
grammatical
constructions
of
CA
that
have
no
counterpart
in
any
modern
vernacular
dialect
(e.g.
the
energetic
mood)
are
almost
never
used
in
Modern
Standard
Arabic.
Case
distinctions
are
very
rare
in
Arabic
vernaculars.
As
a
result
MSA
is
generally
composed
without
case
distinctions
in
mind
and
the
proper
cases
are
added
after
the
fact
when
necessary.
Because
most
case
endings
are
noted
using
final
short
vowels
which
are
normally
left
unwritten
in
the
Arabic
script
it
is
unnecessary
to
determine
the
proper
case
of
most
words.
The
practical
result
of
this
is
that
MSA
like
English
and
Standard
Chinese
is
written
in
a
strongly
determined
word
order
and
alternative
orders
that
were
used
in
CA
for
emphasis
are
rare.
In
addition
because
of
the
lack
of
case
marking
in
the
spoken
varieties
most
speakers
cannot
consistently
use
the
correct
endings
in
extemporaneous
speech.
As
a
result
spoken
MSA
tends
to
drop
or
regularize
the
endings
except
when
reading
from
a
prepared
text.
The
numeral
system
in
CA
is
complex
and
heavily
tied
in
with
the
case
system.
This
system
is
never
used
in
MSA
even
in
the
most
formal
of
circumstances;
instead
a
significantly
simplified
system
is
used
approximating
the
system
of
the
conservative
spoken
varieties.
MSA
uses
much
Classical
vocabulary
(e.g.
dhahaba
to
go)
that
is
not
present
in
the
spoken
varieties
but
deletes
Classical
words
that
sound
obsolete
in
MSA.
In
addition
MSA
has
borrowed
or
coined
many
terms
for
concepts
that
did
not
exist
in
Quranic
times
and
MSA
continues
to
evolve.[41]
Some
words
have
been
borrowed
from
other
languages—notice
that
transliteration
mainly
indicates
spelling
and
not
real
pronunciation
(e.g.
فِلْم‎
film
film
or
ديمقراطية‎
dīmuqrāṭiyyah
democracy).

However
the
current
preference
is
to
avoid
direct
borrowings
preferring
to
either
use
loan
translations
(e.g.
فرع‎
farʻ
branch
also
used
for
the
branch
of
a
company
or
organization;
جناح‎
janāḥ
wing
is
also
used
for
the
wing
of
an
airplane
building
air
force
etc.)
or
to
coin
new
words
using
forms
within
existing
roots
(استماتة‎
istimātah
apoptosis
using
the
root
موت‎
m/w/t
death
put
into
the
Xth
form
or
جامعة‎
jāmiʻah
university
based
on
جمع‎
jamaʻa
to
gather
unite;
جمهورية‎
jumhūriyyah
republic
based
on
جمهور‎
jumhūr
multitude).
An
earlier
tendency
was
to
redefine
an
older
word
although
this
has
fallen
into
disuse
(e.g.
هاتف‎
hātif
telephone

invisible
caller
(in
Sufism);
جريدة‎
jarīdah
newspaper

palm-leaf
stalk).

Colloquial
or
dialectal
Arabic
refers
to
the
many
national
or
regional
varieties
which
constitute
the
everyday
spoken
language
and
evolved
from
Classical
Arabic.
Colloquial
Arabic
has
many
regional
variants;
geographically
distant
varieties
usually
differ
enough
to
be
mutually
unintelligible
and
some
linguists
consider
them
distinct
languages.[42]
However
research
indicates
a
high
degree
of
mutual
intelligibility
between
closely
related
Arabic
variants
for
native
speakers
listening
to
words
sentences
and
texts;
and
between
more
distantly
related
dialects
in
interactional
situations.[43]

The
varieties
are
typically
unwritten.
They
are
often
used
in
informal
spoken
media
such
as
soap
operas
and
talk
shows[44]
as
well
as
occasionally
in
certain
forms
of
written
media
such
as
poetry
and
printed
advertising.

The
only
variety
of
modern
Arabic
to
have
acquired
official
language
status
is
Maltese
which
is
spoken
in
(predominantly
Catholic)
Malta
and
written
with
the
Latin
script.
It
is
descended
from
Classical
Arabic
through
Siculo-Arabic
but
is
not
mutually
intelligible
with
any
other
variety
of
Arabic.
Most
linguists
list
it
as
a
separate
language
rather
than
as
a
dialect
of
Arabic.

Even
during
Muhammads
lifetime
there
were
dialects
of
spoken
Arabic.
Muhammad
spoke
in
the
dialect
of
Mecca
in
the
western
Arabian
peninsula
and
it
was
in
this
dialect
that
the
Quran
was
written
down.
However
the
dialects
of
the
eastern
Arabian
peninsula
were
considered
the
most
prestigious
at
the
time
so
the
language
of
the
Quran
was
ultimately
converted
to
follow
the
eastern
phonology.
It
is
this
phonology
that
underlies
the
modern
pronunciation
of
Classical
Arabic.
The
phonological
differences
between
these
two
dialects
account
for
some
of
the
complexities
of
Arabic
writing
most
notably
the
writing
of
the
glottal
stop
or
hamzah
(which
was
preserved
in
the
eastern
dialects
but
lost
in
western
speech)
and
the
use
of
alif
maqṣūrah
(representing
a
sound
preserved
in
the
western
dialects
but
merged
with
ā
in
eastern
speech).[citation

Language
and
dialect
The
sociolinguistic
situation
of
Arabic
in
modern
times
provides
a
prime
example
of
the
linguistic
phenomenon
of
diglossia
which
is
the
normal
use
of
two
separate
varieties
of
the
same
language
usually
in
different
social
situations.
Tawleed
is
the
process
of
giving
a
new
shade
of
meaning
to
an
old
classical
word.
For
example
al-hatif
lexicographically
means
the
one
whose
sound
is
heard
but
whose
person
remains
unseen.
Now
the
term
al-hatif
is
used
for
a
telephone.
Therefore
the
process
of
tawleed
can
express
the
needs
of
modern
civilization
in
a
manner
that
would
appear
to
be
originally
Arabic.[45]
In
the
case
of
Arabic
educated
Arabs
of
any
nationality
can
be
assumed
to
speak
both
their
school-taught
Standard
Arabic
as
well
as
their
native
mutually
unintelligible
dialects;[46][47][48][49][50]
these
dialects
linguistically
constitute
separate
languages
which
may
have
dialects
of
their
own.[51]
When
educated
Arabs
of
different
dialects
engage
in
conversation
(for
example
a
Moroccan
speaking
with
a
Lebanese)
many
speakers
code-switch
back
and
forth
between
the
dialectal
and
standard
varieties
of
the
language
sometimes
even
within
the
same
sentence.
Arabic
speakers
often
improve
their
familiarity
with
other
dialects
via
music
or
film.

The
issue
of
whether
Arabic
is
one
language
or
many
languages
is
politically
charged
in
the
same
way
it
is
for
the
varieties
of
Chinese
Hindi
and
Urdu
Serbian
and
Croatian
Scots
and
English
etc.
In
contrast
to
speakers
of
Hindi
and
Urdu
who
claim
they
cannot
understand
each
other
even
when
they
can
speakers
of
the
varieties
of
Arabic
will
claim
they
can
all
understand
each
other
even
when
they
cannot.[52]
The
issue
of
diglossia
between
spoken
and
written
language
is
a
significant
complicating
factor:
A
single
written
form
significantly
different
from
any
of
the
spoken
varieties
learned
natively
unites
a
number
of
sometimes
divergent
spoken
forms.
For
political
reasons
Arabs
mostly
assert
that
they
all
speak
a
single
language
despite
significant
issues
of
mutual
incomprehensibility
among
differing
spoken
versions.[53]

From
a
linguistic
standpoint
it
is
often
said
that
the
various
spoken
varieties
of
Arabic
differ
among
each
other
collectively
about
as
much
as
the
Romance
languages.[54]
This
is
an
apt
comparison
in
a
number
of
ways.
The
period
of
divergence
from
a
single
spoken
form
is
similar—perhaps
1500
years
for
Arabic
2000
years
for
the
Romance
languages.
Also
while
it
is
comprehensible
to
people
from
the
Maghreb
a
linguistically
innovative
variety
such
as
Moroccan
Arabic
is
essentially
incomprehensible
to
Arabs
from
the
Mashriq
much
as
French
is
incomprehensible
to
Spanish
or
Italian
speakers
but
relatively
easily
learned
by
them.
This
suggests
that
the
spoken
varieties
may
linguistically
be
considered
separate
languages.

List
of
Arabic
loanwords
in
English
The
influence
of
Arabic
has
been
most
important
in
Islamic
countries
because
it
is
the
language
of
the
Islamic
sacred
book
the
Quran.
Arabic
is
also
an
important
source
of
vocabulary
for
languages
such
as
Amharic
Azerbaijani
Baluchi
Bengali
Berber
Bosnian
Chaldean
Chechen
Chittagonian
Croatian
Dagestani
English
German
Gujarati
Hausa
Hindi
Kazakh
Kurdish

Kyrgyz
Malay
(Malaysian
and
Indonesian)
Pashto

Italian
Portuguese
Sicilian
Spanish
etc.)
Saraiki
Sindhi
Somali
Sylheti
Swahili
Tagalog
Tigrinya
Turkish
Turkmen
Urdu
Uyghur
Uzbek
Visayan
and
Wolof
as
well
as
other
languages
in
countries
where
these
languages
are
spoken.[55]

The
Education
Minister
of
France
Jean-Michel
Blanquer
has
emphasized
the
learning
and
usage
of
Arabic
in
French
schools.[56][57]

In
addition
English
has
many
Arabic
loanwords
some
directly
but
most
via
other
Mediterranean
languages.
Examples
of
such
words
include
admiral
adobe
alchemy
alcohol
algebra
algorithm
alkaline
almanac
amber
arsenal
assassin
candy
carat
cipher
coffee
cotton
ghoul
hazard
jar
kismet
lemon
loofah
magazine
mattress
sherbet
sofa
sumac
tariff
and
zenith.[58]
Other
languages
such
as
Maltese[59]
and
Kinubi
derive
ultimately
from
Arabic
rather
than
merely
borrowing
vocabulary
or
grammatical
rules.

Terms
borrowed
range
from
religious
terminology
(like
Berber
taẓallit
prayer
from
salat
(صلاة‎
ṣalāh))
academic
terms
(like
Uyghur
mentiq
logic)
and
economic
items
(like
English
coffee)
to
placeholders
(like
Spanish
fulano
so-and-so)
everyday
terms
(like
Hindustani
lekin
but
or
Spanish
taza
and
French
tasse
meaning
cup)
and
expressions
(like
Catalan
a
betzef
galore
in
quantity).
Most
Berber
varieties
(such
as
Kabyle)
along
with
Swahili
borrow
some
numbers
from
Arabic.
Most
Islamic
religious
terms
are
direct
borrowings
from
Arabic
such
as
صلاة‎
(salat)
prayer
and
إمام‎
(imam)
prayer
leader.

In
languages
not
directly
in
contact
with
the
Arab
world
Arabic
loanwords
are
often
transferred
indirectly
via
other
languages
rather
than
being
transferred
directly
from
Arabic.
For
example
most
Arabic
loanwords
in
Hindustani
and
Turkish
entered
though
Persian
is
an
Indo-Iranian
language.
Older
Arabic
loanwords
in
Hausa
were
borrowed
from
Kanuri.

Arabic
words
also
made
their
way
into
several
West
African
languages
as
Islam
spread
across
the
Sahara.
Variants
of
Arabic
words
such
as
كتاب‎
kitāb
(book)
have
spread
to
the
languages
of
African
groups
who
had
no
direct
contact
with
Arab
traders.[60]

Since
throughout
the
Islamic
world
Arabic
occupied
a
position
similar
to
that
of
Latin
in
Europe
many
of
the
Arabic
concepts
in
the
fields
of
science
philosophy
commerce
etc.
were
coined
from
Arabic
roots
by
non-native
Arabic
speakers
notably
by
Aramaic
and
Persian
translators
and
then
found
their
way
into
other
languages.
This
process
of
using
Arabic
roots
especially
in
Kurdish
and
Persian
to
translate
foreign
concepts
continued
through
to
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
when
swaths
of
Arab-inhabited
lands
were
under
Ottoman
rule.

Influence
of
other
languages
on
Arabic
The
most
important
sources
of
borrowings
into
(pre-Islamic)
Arabic
are
from
the
related
(Semitic)
languages
Aramaic[61]
which
used
to
be
the
principal
international
language
of
communication
throughout
the
ancient
Near
and
Middle
East
and
Ethiopic.
In
addition
many
cultural
religious
and
political
terms
have
entered
Arabic
from
Iranian
languages
notably
Middle
Persian
Parthian
and
(Classical)
Persian[62]
and
Hellenistic
Greek
(kīmiyāʼ

as

the

Some
Arabic

Semitic
or
Persian
languages
are
as
presented
in
De
Prémares
above-cited
book:

madīnah/medina
(مدينة
city
or
city
square)
a
word
of
Aramaic
origin
(in
which
it
means
a
state)
jazīrah
(جزيرة)
as
in
the
well-known
form
الجزيرة
Al-Jazeera
means
island
and
has
its
origin
in
the
Syriac
ܓܙܝܪܗ
gazīra.
lāzaward
(لازورد)
is
taken
from
Persian
لاژورد
lājvard
the
name
of
a
blue
stone
lapis
lazuli.
This
word
was
borrowed
in
several
European
languages
to
mean
(light)
blue
–
azure
in
English
azur
in
French
and
azul
in
Portuguese
and
Spanish.

of
the
influence
of
other
languages
on
Arabic
is

Manfredi

Arabic
alphabet
and
nationalism
There
have
been
many
instances
of
national
movements
to
convert
Arabic
script
into
Latin
script
or
to
Romanize
the
language.
Currently
the
only
language
derived
from
Classical
Arabic
to
use
Latin
script
is
Maltese.

Lebanon
The
Beirut
newspaper
La
Syrie
pushed
for
the
change
from
Arabic
script
to
Latin
letters
in
1922.
The
major
head
of
this
movement
was
Louis
Massignon
a
French
Orientalist
who
brought
his
concern
before
the
Arabic
Language
Academy
in
Damascus
in
1928.
Massignons
attempt
at
Romanization
failed
as
the
Academy
and
population
viewed
the
proposal
as
an
attempt
from
the
Western
world
to
take
over
their
country.
Said
Afghani
a
member
of
the
Academy
mentioned
that
the
movement
to
Romanize
the
script
was
a
Zionist
plan
to
dominate
Lebanon.[63][64]

Egypt
After
the
period
of
colonialism
in
Egypt
Egyptians
were
looking
for
a
way
to
reclaim
and
re-emphasize
Egyptian
culture.
As
a
result
some
Egyptians
pushed
for
an
Egyptianization
of
the
Arabic
language
in
which
the
formal
Arabic
and
the
colloquial
Arabic
would
be
combined
into
one
language
and
the
Latin
alphabet
would
be
used.[63][64]
There
was
also
the
idea
of
finding
a
way
to
use
Hieroglyphics
instead
of
the
Latin
alphabet
but
this
was
seen
as
too
complicated
to
use.[63][64]
A
scholar
Salama
Musa
agreed
with
the
idea
of
applying
a
Latin
alphabet
to
Arabic
as
he
believed
that
would
allow
Egypt
to
have
a
closer
relationship
with
the
West.
He
also
believed
that
Latin
script
was
key
to
the
success
of
Egypt
as
it
would
allow
for
more
advances
in
science
and
technology.
This
change
in
alphabet
he
believed
would
solve
the
problems
inherent
with
Arabic
such
as
a
lack
of
written
vowels
and
difficulties
writing
foreign
words
that
made
it
difficult
for
non-native
speakers
to
learn.[63][64]
Ahmad
Lutfi
As
Sayid
and
Muhammad
Azmi
two
Egyptian
intellectuals
agreed
with
Musa
and
supported
the
push
for
Romanization.[63][65]
The
idea
that
Romanization
was
necessary
for
modernization
and
growth
in
Egypt
continued
with
Abd
Al-Aziz
Fahmi
in
1944.
He
was
the
chairman
for
the
Writing
and
Grammar
Committee
for
the
Arabic
Language
Academy
of
Cairo.[63][65]
However
this
effort
failed
as
the
Egyptian
people
felt
a
strong
cultural
tie
to
the
Arabic
alphabet.[63][65]
In
particular
the
older
Egyptian
generations
believed
that
the
Arabic
alphabet
had
strong
connections
to
Arab
values
and
history
due
to
the
long
history
of
the
Arabic
alphabet
(Shrivtiel
189)
in
Muslim
societies.

The
language
of
the
Quran
and
its
influence
on
poetry
The
Quran
introduced
a
new
way
of
writing
to
the
world.
People
began
studying
and
applying
the
unique
styles
they
learned
from
the
Quran
to
not
only
their
own
writing
but
also
their
culture.
Writers
studied
the
unique
structure
and
format
of
the
Quran
in
order
to
identify
and
apply
the
figurative
devices
and
their
impact
on
the
reader.

Qurans
figurative
devices
The
Quran
inspired
musicality
in
poetry
through
the
internal
rhythm
of
the
verses.
The
arrangement
of
words
how
certain
sounds
create
harmony
and
the
agreement
of
rhymes
create
the
sense
of
rhythm
within
each
verse.
At
times
the
chapters
of
the
Quran
only
have
the
rhythm
in
common.[66]

The
repetition
in
the
Quran
introduced
the
true
power
and
impact
repetition
can
have
in
poetry.
The
repetition
of
certain
words
and
phrases
made
them
appear
more
firm
and
explicit
in
the
Quran.
The
Quran
uses
constant
metaphors
of
blindness
and
deafness
to
imply
unbelief.
Metaphors
were
not
a
new
concept
to
poetry
however
the
strength
of
extended
metaphors
was.
The
explicit
imagery
in
the
Quran
inspired
many
poets
to
include
and
focus
on
the
feature
in
their
own
work.
The
poet
ibn
al-Mutazz
wrote
a
book
regarding
the
figures
of
speech
inspired
by
his
study
of
the
Quran.
Poets
such
as
badr
Shakir
al
sayyab
expresses
his
political
opinion
in
his
work
through
imagery
inspired
by
the
forms
of
more
harsher
imagery
used
in
the
Quran.[67]
The
Quran
uses
figurative
devices
in
order
to
express
the
meaning
in
the
most
beautiful
form
possible.
The
study
of
the
pauses
in
the
Quran
as
well
as
other
rhetoric
allow
it
to
be
approached
in
a
multiple
ways.[68]

Structure
Although
the
Quran
is
known
for
its
fluency
and
harmony
the
structure
can
be
best
described
as
not
always
being
inherently
chronological
but
can
also
flow
thematically
instead
(the
chapters
in
the
Quran
have
segments
that
flow
in
chronological
order
however
segments
can
transition
into
other
segments
not
related
in
chronology
but
could
be
related
in
topic).
The
suras
also
known
as
chapters
of
the
Quran
are
not
placed
in
chronological
order.
The
only
constant
in
their
structure
is
that
the
longest
are
placed
first
and
shorter
ones
follow.
The
topics
discussed
in
the
chapters
can
also
have
no
direct
relation
to
each
other
(as
seen
in
many
suras)
and
can
share
in
their
sense
of
rhyme.
The
Quran
introduces
to
poetry
the
idea
of
abandoning
order
and
scattering
narratives
throughout
the
text.
Harmony
is
also
present
in
the
sound
of
the
Quran.
The
elongations
and
accents
present
in
the
Quran
create
a
harmonious
flow
within
the
writing.
Unique
sound
of
the
Quran
recited
due
to
the
accents
create
a
deeper
level
of
understanding
through
a
deeper
emotional
connection.[67]

The
Quran
is
written
in
a
language
that
is
simple
and
understandable
by
people.
The
simplicity
of
the
writing
inspired
later
poets
to
write
in
a
more
clear
and
clear-cut
style.[67]
The
words
of
the
Quran
although
unchanged
are
to
this
day
understandable
and
frequently
used
in
both
formal
and
informal
Arabic.
The
simplicity
of
the
language
makes
memorizing
and
reciting
the
Quran
a
slightly
easier
task.

Culture
and
the
Quran
The
writer
al-Khattabi
explains
how
culture
is
a
required
element
to
create
a
sense
of
art
in
work
as
well
as
understand
it.
He
believes
that
the
fluency
and
harmony
which
the
Quran
possess
are
not
the
only
elements
that
make
it
beautiful
and
create
a
bond
between
the
reader
and
the
text.
While
a
lot
of
poetry
was
deemed
comparable
to
the
Quran
in
that
it
is
equal
to
or
better
than
the
composition
of
the
Quran
a
debate
rose
that
such
statements
are
not
possible
because
humans
are
incapable
of
composing
work
comparable
to
the
Quran.[68]
Because
the
structure
of
the
Quran
made
it
difficult
for
a
clear
timeline
to
be
seen
Hadith
were
the
main
source
of
chronological
order.
The
Hadith
were
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
this
tradition
became
a
large
resource
for
understanding
the
context.
Poetry
after
the
Quran
began
possessing
this
element
of
tradition
by
including
ambiguity
and
background
information
to
be
required
to
understand
the
meaning.[66]

After
the
Quran
came
down
to
the
people
the
tradition
of
memorizing
the
verses
became
present.
It
is
believed
that
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
Quran
memorized
the
greater
the
faith.
As
technology
improved
over
time
hearing
recitations
of
the
Quran
became
more
available
as
well
as
more
tools
to
help
memorize
the
verses.
The
tradition
of
Love
Poetry
served
as
a
symbolic
representation
of
a
Muslims
desire
for
a
closer
contact
with
their
Lord.

While
the
influence
of
the
Quran
on
Arabic
poetry
is
explained
and
defended
by
numerous
writers
some
writers
such
as
Al-Baqillani
believe
that
poetry
and
the
Quran
are
in
no
conceivable
way
related
due
to
the
uniqueness
of
the
Quran.
Poetrys
imperfections
prove
his
points
that
they
cannot
be
compared
with
the
fluency
the
Quran
holds.

Arabic
and
Islam
Classical
Arabic
is
the
language
of
poetry
and
literature
(including
news);
it
is
also
mainly
the
language
of
the
Quran.
Classical
Arabic
is
closely
associated
with
the
religion
of
Islam
because
the
Quran
was
written
in
it.
Most
of
the
worlds
Muslims
do
not
speak
Classical
Arabic
as
their
native
language
but
many
can
read
the
Quranic
script
and
recite
the
Quran.
Among
non-Arab
Muslims
translations
of
the
Quran
are
most
often
accompanied
by
the
original
text.
At
present
Modern
Standard
Arabic
(MSA)
is
also
used
in
modernized
versions
of
literary
forms
of
the
Quran.

Some
Muslims
present
a
monogenesis
of
languages
and
claim
that
the
Arabic
language
was
the
language
revealed
by
God
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
and
the
original
language
as
a
prototype
system
of
symbolic
communication
based
upon
its
system
of
triconsonantal
roots
spoken
by
man
from
which
all
other
languages
were
derived
having
first
been
corrupted.[69]
Judaism
has
a
similar
account
with
the
Tower
of
Babel.

Dialects
and
descendants
Main
article:
Varieties
of
Arabic

Different
dialects
of
Arabic
Colloquial
Arabic
is
a
collective
term
for
the
spoken
dialects
of
Arabic
used
throughout
the
Arab
world
which
differ
radically
from
the
literary
language.
The
main
dialectal
division
is
between
the
varieties
within
and
outside
of
the
Arabian
peninsula
followed
by
that
between
sedentary
varieties
and
the
much
more
conservative
Bedouin
varieties.
All
the
varieties
outside
of
the
Arabian
peninsula
(which
include
the
large
majority
of
speakers)
have
many
features
in
common
with
each
other
that
are
not
found
in
Classical
Arabic.
This
has
led
researchers
to
postulate
the
existence
of
a
prestige
koine
dialect
in
the
one
or
two
centuries
immediately
following
the
Arab
conquest
whose
features
eventually
spread
to
all
newly
conquered
areas.
These
features
are
present
to
varying
degrees
inside
the
Arabian
peninsula.
Generally
the
Arabian
peninsula
varieties
have
much
more
diversity
than
the
non-peninsula
varieties
but
these
have
been
understudied.

Within
the
non-peninsula
varieties
the
largest
difference
is
between
the
non-Egyptian
North
African
dialects
(especially
Moroccan
Arabic)
and
the
others.
Moroccan
Arabic
in
particular
is
hardly
comprehensible
to
Arabic
speakers
east
of
Libya
(although
the
converse
is
not
true
in
part
due
to
the
popularity
of
Egyptian
films
and
other
media).

One
factor
in
the
differentiation
of
the
dialects
is
influence
from
the
languages
previously
spoken
in
the
areas
which
have
typically
provided
a
significant
number
of
new
words
and
have
sometimes
also
influenced
pronunciation
or
word
order;
however
a
much
more
significant
factor
for
most
dialects
is
as
among
Romance
languages
retention
(or
change
of
meaning)
of
different
classical
forms.
Thus
Iraqi
aku
Levantine
fīh
and
North
African
kayən
all
mean
there
is
and
all
come
from
Classical
Arabic
forms
(yakūn
fīhi
kāin
respectively)
but
now
sound
very
different.

Examples
Transcription
is
a
broad
IPA
transcription
so
minor
differences
were
ignored
for
easier
comparison.
Also
the
pronunciation
of
Modern
Standard
Arabic
differs
significantly
from
region
to
region.

Koiné
According
to
Charles
A.
Ferguson[70]
the
following
are
some
of
the
characteristic
features
of
the
koiné
that
underlies
all
the
modern
dialects
outside
the
Arabian
peninsula.
Although
many
other
features
are
common
to
most
or
all
of
these
varieties
Ferguson
believes
that
these
features
in
particular
are
unlikely
to
have
evolved
independently
more
than
once
or
twice
and
together
suggest
the
existence
of
the
koine:

Loss
of
the
dual
number
except
on
nouns
with
consistent
plural
agreement
(cf.
feminine
singular
agreement
in
plural
inanimates).
Change
of
a
to
i
in
many
affixes
(e.g.
non-past-tense
prefixes
ti-
yi-
ni-;
wi-
and;
il-
the;
feminine
-it
in
the
construct
state).
Loss
of
third-weak
verbs
ending
in
w
(which
merge
with
verbs
ending
in
y).
Reformation
of
geminate
verbs
e.g.
ḥalaltu
I
untied
→
ḥalēt(u).
Conversion
of
separate
words
lī
to
me
laka
to
you
etc.
into
indirect-object
clitic
suffixes.
Certain
changes
in
the
cardinal
number
system
e.g.
khamsat
ayyām
five
days
→
kham(a)s
tiyyām
where
certain
words
have
a
special
plural
with
prefixed
t.
Loss
of
the
feminine
elative
(comparative).
Adjective
plurals
of
the
form
kibār
big
→
kubār.
Change
of
nisba
suffix
-iyy

i.
Certain
lexical
items
e.g.
jāb
bring

jāʼa
bi-
come
with;
shāf
see;
ēsh
what
(or
similar)

ayyu
shayʼ
which
thing;
illi
(relative
pronoun).
Merger
of
/ɮˤ/
and
/ðˤ/.

53
million
people
in
Egypt
(55
million

It
is
one
of
the
most
understood
varieties
of
Arabic
due
in
large
part
to
the
widespread
distribution
of
Egyptian
films
and
television

Maghrebi
Arabic
also
called

It
also
forms
the

is
very
hard
to

Siculo-Arabic
(Sicilian
Arabic)
was
spoken
in
Sicily
and
Malta
between
the
end
of
the
9th
century
and
the
end
of
the
12th
century
and
eventually
evolved
into
the
Maltese
language.
Maltese
spoken
on
the
island
of
Malta
is
the
only
fully
separate
standardized
language
to
have
originated
from
an
Arabic
dialect
(the
extinct
Siculo-Arabic
dialect)
with
independent
literary
norms.
Maltese
has
evolved
independently
of
Literary
Arabic
and
its
varieties
into
a
standardized
language
over
the
past
800
years
in
a
gradual
process
of
Latinisation.[73][74]
Maltese
is
therefore
considered
an
exceptional
descendant
of
Arabic
that
has
no
diglossic
relationship
with
Standard
Arabic
or
Classical
Arabic.[75]
Maltese
is
also
different
from
Arabic
and
other
Semitic
languages
since
its
morphology
has
been
deeply
influenced
by
Romance
languages
Italian
and
Sicilian.[76]
It
is
also
the
only
Semitic
language
written
in
the
Latin
script.
In
terms
of
basic
everyday
language
speakers
of
Maltese
are
reported
to
be
able
to
understand
less
than
a
third
of
what
is
said
to
them
in
Tunisian
Arabic[77]
which
is
related
to
Siculo-Arabic[72]
whereas
speakers
of
Tunisian
are
able
to
understand
about
40
of
what
is
said
to
them
in
Maltese.[78]
This
asymmetric
intelligibility
is
considerably
lower
than
the
mutual
intelligibility
found
between
Maghrebi
Arabic
dialects.[79]
Maltese
has
its
own
dialects
with
urban
varieties
of
Maltese
being
closer
to
Standard
Maltese
than
rural
varieties.[80]

Phonology
Main
article:
Arabic
phonology
History
Of
the
29
Proto-Semitic
consonants
only
one
has
been
lost:
*/ʃ/
which
merged
with
/s/
while
/ɬ/
became
/ʃ/
(see
Semitic
languages).[83]
Various
other
consonants
have
changed
their
sound
too
but
have
remained
distinct.
An
original
*/p/
lenited
to
/f/
and
*/ɡ/
–
consistently
attested
in
pre-Islamic
Greek
transcription
of
Arabic
languages[84]
–
became
palatalized
to
/ɡʲ/
or
/ɟ/
by
the
time
of
the
Quran
and
/d͡ʒ/
/ɡ/
/ʒ/
or
/ɟ/
after
early
Muslim
conquests
and
in
MSA
(see
Arabic
phonologyLocal
variations
for
more
detail).[85]
An
original
voiceless
alveolar
lateral
fricative
*/ɬ/
became
/ʃ/.[86]
Its
emphatic
counterpart
/ɬˠ~ɮˤ/
was
considered
by
Arabs
to
be
the
most
unusual
sound
in
Arabic
(Hence
the
Classical
Arabics
appellation
لُغَةُ
ٱلضَّادِ‎
lughat
al-ḍād
or
language
of
the
ḍād);
for
most
modern
dialects
it
has
become
an
emphatic
stop
/dˤ/
with
loss
of
the
laterality[86]
or
with
complete
loss
of
any
pharyngealization
or
velarization
/d/.
(The
classical
ḍād
pronunciation
of
pharyngealization
/ɮˤ/
still
occurs
in
the
Mehri
language
and
the
similar
sound
without
velarization
/ɮ/
exists
in
other
Modern
South
Arabian
languages.)

Other
changes
may
also
have
happened.
Classical
Arabic
pronunciation
is
not
thoroughly
recorded
and
different
reconstructions
of
the
sound
system
of
Proto-Semitic
propose
different
phonetic
values.
One
example
is
the
emphatic
consonants
which
are
pharyngealized
in
modern
pronunciations
but
may
have
been
velarized
in
the
eighth
century
and
glottalized
in
Proto-Semitic.[86]

Reduction
of
/j/
and
/w/
between
vowels
occurs
in
a
number
of
circumstances
and
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
complexity
of
third-weak
(defective)
verbs.
Early
Akkadian
transcriptions
of
Arabic
names
shows
that
this
reduction
had
not
yet
occurred
as
of
the
early
part
of
the
1st
millennium
BC.

The
Classical
Arabic
language
as
recorded
was
a
poetic
koine
that
reflected
a
consciously
archaizing
dialect
chosen
based
on
the
tribes
of
the
western
part
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula
who
spoke
the
most
conservative
variants
of
Arabic.
Even
at
the
time
of
Muhammed
and
before
other
dialects
existed
with
many
more
changes
including
the
loss
of
most
glottal
stops
the
loss
of
case
endings
the
reduction
of
the
diphthongs
/aj/
and
/aw/
into
monophthongs
/eː
oː/
etc.
Most
of
these
changes
are
present
in
most
or
all
modern
varieties
of
Arabic.

An
interesting
feature
of
the
writing
system
of
the
Quran
(and
hence
of
Classical
Arabic)
is
that
it
contains
certain
features
of
Muhammads
native
dialect
of
Mecca
corrected
through
diacritics
into
the
forms
of
standard
Classical
Arabic.
Among
these
features
visible
under
the
corrections
are
the
loss
of
the
glottal
stop
and
a
differing
development
of
the
reduction
of
certain
final
sequences
containing
/j/:
Evidently
final
/-awa/
became
/aː/
as
in
the
Classical
language
but
final
/-aja/
became
a
different
sound
possibly
/eː/
(rather
than
again
/aː/
in
the
Classical
language).
This
is
the
apparent
source
of
the
alif
maqṣūrah
restricted
alif
where
a
final
/-aja/
is
reconstructed:
a
letter
that
would
normally
indicate
/j/
or
some
similar
high-vowel
sound
but
is
taken
in
this
context
to
be
a
logical
variant
of
alif
and
represent
the
sound
/aː/.

Although
Classical
Arabic
was
a
unitary
language
and
is
now
used
in
Quran
its
pronunciation
varies
somewhat
from
country
to
country
and
from
region
to
region
within
a
country.
It
is
influenced
by
colloquial
dialects.

Literary
Arabic
The
colloquial
spoken
dialects
of
Arabic
are
learned
at
home
and
constitute
the
native
languages
of
Arabic
speakers.
Formal
Literary
Arabic
(usually
specifically
Modern
Standard
Arabic)
is
learned
at
school;
although
many
speakers
have
a
native-like
command
of
the
language
it
is
technically
not
the
native
language
of
any
speakers.
Both
varieties
can
be
both
written
and
spoken
although
the
colloquial
varieties
are
rarely
written
down
and
the
formal
variety
is
spoken
mostly
in
formal
circumstances
e.g.
in
radio
and
TV
broadcasts
formal
lectures
parliamentary
discussions
and
to
some
extent
between
speakers
of
different
colloquial
dialects.
Even
when
the
literary
language
is
spoken
however
it
is
normally
only
spoken
in
its
pure
form
when
reading
a
prepared
text
out
loud
and
communication
between
speakers
of
different
colloquial
dialects.
When
speaking
extemporaneously
(i.e.
making
up
the
language
on
the
spot
as
in
a
normal
discussion
among
people)
speakers
tend
to
deviate
somewhat
from
the
strict
literary
language
in
the
direction
of
the
colloquial
varieties.
In
fact
there
is
a
continuous
range
of
in-between
spoken
varieties:
from
nearly
pure
Modern
Standard
Arabic
(MSA)
to
a
form
that
still
uses
MSA
grammar
and
vocabulary
but
with
significant
colloquial
influence
to
a
form
of
the
colloquial
language
that
imports
a
number
of
words
and
grammatical
constructions
in
MSA
to
a
form
that
is
close
to
pure
colloquial
but
with
the
rough
edges
(the
most
noticeably
vulgar
or
non-Classical
aspects)
smoothed
out
to
pure
colloquial.
The
particular
variant
(or
register)
used
depends
on
the
social
class
and
education
level
of
the
speakers
involved
and
the
level
of
formality
of
the
speech
situation.
Often
it
will
vary
within
a
single
encounter
e.g.
moving
from
nearly
pure
MSA
to
a
more
mixed
language
in
the
process
of
a
radio
interview
as
the
interviewee
becomes
more
comfortable
with
the
interviewer.
This
type
of
variation
is
characteristic
of
the
diglossia
that
exists
throughout
the
Arabic-speaking
world.

Recording
of
a
poem
by
Al-Maarri
titled
I
no
longer
steal
from
nature
Although
Modern
Standard
Arabic
(MSA)
is
a
unitary
language
its
pronunciation
varies
somewhat
from
country
to
country
and
from
region
to
region
within
a
country.
The
variation
in
individual
accents
of
MSA
speakers
tends
to
mirror
corresponding
variations
in
the
colloquial
speech
of
the
speakers
in
question
but
with
the
distinguishing
characteristics
moderated
somewhat.
It
is
important
in
descriptions
of
Arabic
phonology
to
distinguish
between
pronunciation
of
a
given
colloquial
(spoken)
dialect
and
the
pronunciation
of
MSA
by
these
same
speakers.
Although
they
are
related
they
are
not
the
same.
For
example
the
phoneme
that
derives
from
Classical
Arabic
/ɟ/
has
many
different
pronunciations
in
the
modern
spoken
varieties
e.g.
[d͡ʒ
~
ʒ
~
j
~
ɡʲ
~
ɡ]
including
the
proposed
original
[ɟ].
Speakers
whose
native
variety
has
either
[d͡ʒ]
or
[ʒ]
will
use
the
same
pronunciation
when
speaking
MSA.
Even
speakers
from
Cairo
whose
native
Egyptian
Arabic
has
[ɡ]
normally
use
[ɡ]
when
speaking
MSA.
The
[j]
of
Persian
Gulf
speakers
is
the
only
variant
pronunciation
which
isnt
found
in
MSA;
[d͡ʒ~ʒ]
is
used
instead
but
may
use
[j]
in
MSA
for
comfortable
pronunciation.
Another
reason
of
different
pronunciations
is
influence
of
colloquial
dialects.
The
differentiation
of
pronunciation
of
colloquial
dialects
is
the
influence
from
other
languages
previously
spoken
and
some
still
presently
spoken
in
the
regions
such
as
Coptic
in
Egypt
Berber
Punic
or
Phoenician
in
North
Africa
Himyaritic
Modern
South
Arabian
and
Old
South
Arabian
in
Yemen
and
Oman
and
Aramaic
and
Canaanite
languages
(including
Phoenician)
in
the
Levant
and
Mesopotamia.

Another
example:
Many
colloquial
varieties
are
known
for
a
type
of
vowel
harmony
in
which
the
presence
of
an
emphatic
consonant
triggers
backed
allophones
of
nearby
vowels
(especially
of
the
low
vowels
/aː/
which
are
backed
to
[ɑ(ː)]
in
these
circumstances
and
very
often
fronted
to
[æ(ː)]
in
all
other
circumstances).
In
many
spoken
varieties
the
backed
or
emphatic
vowel
allophones
spread
a
fair
distance
in
both
directions
from
the
triggering
consonant;
in
some
varieties
(most
notably
Egyptian
Arabic)
the
emphatic
allophones
spread
throughout
the
entire
word
usually
including
prefixes
and
suffixes
even
at
a
distance
of
several
syllables
from
the
triggering
consonant.
Speakers
of
colloquial
varieties
with
this
vowel
harmony
tend
to
introduce
it
into
their
MSA
pronunciation
as
well
but
usually
with
a
lesser
degree
of
spreading
than
in
the
colloquial
varieties.
(For
example
speakers
of
colloquial
varieties
with
extremely
long-distance
harmony
may
allow
a
moderate
but
not
extreme
amount
of
spreading
of
the
harmonic
allophones
in
their
MSA
speech
while
speakers
of
colloquial
varieties
with
moderate-distance
harmony
may
only
harmonize
immediately
adjacent
vowels
in
MSA.)

Vowels
Modern
Standard
Arabic
has
six
pure
vowels
(while
most
modern
dialects
have
eight
pure
vowels
which
includes
the
long
vowels
/eː
oː/)
with
short
/a
i
u/
and
corresponding
long
vowels
/aː
iː
uː/.
There
are
also
two
diphthongs:
/aj/
and
/aw/.

The
pronunciation
of
the
vowels
differs
from
speaker
to
speaker
in
a
way
that
tends
to
reflect
the
pronunciation
of
the
corresponding
colloquial
variety.
Nonetheless
there
are
some
common
trends.
Most
noticeable
is
the
differing
pronunciation
of
/a/
and
/aː/
which
tend
towards
fronted
[æ(ː)]
[a(ː)]
or
[ɛ(ː)]
in
most
situations
but
a
back
[ɑ(ː)]
in
the
neighborhood
of
emphatic
consonants.
Some
accents
and
dialects
such
as
those
of
the
Hejaz
region
have
an
open
[a(ː)]
or
a
central
[ä(ː)]
in
all
situations.
The
vowel
/a/
varies
towards
[ə(ː)]
too.
Listen
to
the
final
vowel
in
the
recording
of
al-ʻarabiyyah
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
for
example.
The
point
is
Arabic
has
only
three
short
vowel
phonemes
so
those
phonemes
can
have
a
very
wide
range
of
allophones.
The
vowels
/u/
and
/ɪ/
are
often
affected
somewhat
in
emphatic
neighborhoods
as
well
with
generally
more
back
or
centralized
allophones
but
the
differences
are
less
great
than
for
the
low
vowels.
The
pronunciation
of
short
/u/
and
/i/
tends
towards
[ʊ~o]
and
[i~e~ɨ]
respectively
in
many
dialects.

The
definition
of
both
emphatic
and
neighborhood
vary
in
ways
that
reflect
(to
some
extent)
corresponding
variations
in
the
spoken
dialects.
Generally
the
consonants
triggering
emphatic
allophones
are
the
pharyngealized
consonants
/tˤ
dˤ
sˤ
ðˤ/;
/q/;
and
/r/
if
not
followed
immediately
by
/i(ː)/.
Frequently
the
velar
fricatives
/x
ɣ/
also
trigger
emphatic
allophones;
occasionally
also
the
pharyngeal
consonants
/ʕ
ħ/
(the
former
more
than
the
latter).
Many
dialects
have
multiple
emphatic
allophones
of
each
vowel
depending
on
the
particular
nearby
consonants.
In
most
MSA
accents
emphatic
coloring
of
vowels
is
limited
to
vowels
immediately
adjacent
to
a
triggering
consonant
although
in
some
it
spreads
a
bit
farther:
e.g.
وقت‎
waqt
[wɑqt]
time;
وطن‎
waṭan
[wɑtˤɑn]
homeland;
وسط
المدينة‎
wasṭ
al-madīnah
[wæstˤ
ɑl
mædiːnɐ]
downtown
(sometimes
[wɑstˤ
ɑl
mædiːnæ]
or
similar).

In
a
non-emphatic
environment
the
vowel
/a/
in
the
diphthong
/aj/
tends
to
be
fronted
even
more
than
elsewhere
often
pronounced
[æj]
or
[ɛj]:
hence
سيف‎
sayf
[sajf
~
sæjf
~
sɛjf]
sword
but
صيف‎
ṣayf
[sˤɑjf]
summer.
However
in
accents
with
no
emphatic
allophones
of
/a/
(e.g.
in
the
Hejaz)
the
pronunciation
[aj]
or
[äj]
occurs
in
all
situations.

The
phoneme
/d͡ʒ/
is
represented
by
the
Arabic
letter
jīm
(ج‎)
and
has
many
standard
pronunciations.
[d͡ʒ]
is
characteristic
of
north
Algeria
Iraq
and
most
of
the
Arabian
peninsula
but
with
an
allophonic
[ʒ]
in
some
positions;
[ʒ]
occurs
in
most
of
the
Levant
and
most
of
North
Africa;
and
[ɡ]
is
used
in
most
of
Egypt
and
some
regions
in
Yemen
and
Oman.
Generally
this
corresponds
with
the
pronunciation
in
the
colloquial
dialects.[87]
In
some
regions
in
Sudan
and
Yemen
as
well
as
in
some
Sudanese
and
Yemeni
dialects
it
may
be
either
[ɡʲ]
or
[ɟ]
representing
the
original
pronunciation
of
Classical
Arabic.
Foreign
words
containing
/ɡ/
may
be
transcribed
with
ج‎
غ‎
ك‎
ق‎
گ‎
ݣ‎
or
ڨ‎
mainly
depending
on
the
regional
spoken
variety
of
Arabic
or
the
commonly
diacriticized
Arabic
letter.
In
northern
Egypt
where
the
Arabic
letter
jīm
(ج‎)
is
normally
pronounced
[ɡ]
a
separate
phoneme
/ʒ/
which
may
be
transcribed
with
چ‎
occurs
in
a
small
number
of
mostly
non-Arabic
loanwords
e.g.
/ʒakitta/
jacket.

/θ/
(ث‎)
can
be
pronounced
as
[s].
In
some
places
of
Maghreb
it
can
be
also
pronounced
as
[t͡s].

/x/
and
/ɣ/
(خ‎
غ‎)
are
velar
post-velar
or
uvular.[88]

In
many
varieties
/ħ
ʕ/
(ح‎
ع‎)
are
epiglottal
[ʜ
ʢ]
in
Western
Asia.

/l/
is
pronounced
as
velarized
[ɫ]
in
الله
/ʔallaːh/
the
name
of
God
q.e.
Allah
when
the
word
follows
a
ā
u
or
ū
(after
i
or
ī
it
is
unvelarized:
بسم
الله‎
bismi
l–lāh
/bismillaːh/).
Some
speakers
velarize
other
occurrences
of
/l/
in
MSA
in
imitation
of
their
spoken
dialects.

The
emphatic
consonant
/dˤ/
was
actually
pronounced
[ɮˤ]
or
possibly
[d͡ɮˤ][89]—either
way
a
highly
unusual
sound.
The
medieval
Arabs
actually
termed
their
language
lughat
al-ḍād
the
language
of
the
Ḍād
(the
name
of
the
letter
used
for
this
sound)
since
they
thought
the
sound
was
unique
to
their
language.
(In
fact
it
also
exists
in
a
few
other
minority
Semitic
languages
e.g.
Mehri.)

Arabic
has
consonants
traditionally
termed
emphatic
/tˤ
dˤ
sˤ
ðˤ/
(ط‎
ض‎
ص‎
ظ‎)
which
exhibit
simultaneous
pharyngealization
[tˤ
dˤ
sˤ
ðˤ]
as
well
as
varying
degrees
of
velarization
[tˠ
dˠ
sˠ
ðˠ]
(depending
on
the
region)
so
they
may
be
written
with
the
Velarized
or
pharyngealized
diacritic
(
̴)
as:
/t̴
d̴
s̴
ð̴/.
This
simultaneous
articulation
is
described
as
Retracted
Tongue
Root
by
phonologists.[90]
In
some
transcription
systems
emphasis
is
shown
by
capitalizing
the
letter
for
example
/dˤ/
is
written
⟨D⟩;
in
others
the
letter
is
underlined
or
has
a
dot
below
it
for
example
⟨ḍ⟩.

Vowels
and
consonants
can
be
phonologically
short
or
long.
Long
(geminate)
consonants
are
normally
written
doubled
in
Latin
transcription
(i.e.
bb
dd
etc.)
reflecting
the
presence
of
the
Arabic
diacritic
mark
shaddah
which
indicates
doubled
consonants.
In
actual
pronunciation
doubled
consonants
are
held
twice
as
long
as
short
consonants.
This
consonant
lengthening
is
phonemically
contrastive:
قبل‎
qabila
he
accepted
vs.
قبّل‎
qabbala
he
kissed.

Syllable
structure
Arabic
has
two
kinds
of
syllables:
open
syllables
(CV)
and
(CVV)—and
closed
syllables
(CVC)
(CVVC)
and
(CVCC).
The
syllable
types
with
two
morae
(units
of
time)
i.e.
CVC
and
CVV
are
termed
heavy
syllables
while
those
with
three
morae
i.e.
CVVC
and
CVCC
are
superheavy
syllables.
Superheavy
syllables
in
Classical
Arabic
occur
in
only
two
places:
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
(due
to
pausal
pronunciation)
and
in
words
such
as
حارّ‎
ḥārr
hot
مادّة‎
māddah
stuff
substance
تحاجوا‎
taḥājjū
they
disputed
with
each
other
where
a
long
ā
occurs
before
two
identical
consonants
(a
former
short
vowel
between
the
consonants
has
been
lost).
(In
less
formal
pronunciations
of
Modern
Standard
Arabic
superheavy
syllables
are
common
at
the
end
of
words
or
before
clitic
suffixes
such
as
-nā
us
our
due
to
the
deletion
of
final
short
vowels.)

In
surface
pronunciation
every
vowel
must
be
preceded
by
a
consonant
(which
may
include
the
glottal
stop
[ʔ]).
There
are
no
cases
of
hiatus
within
a
word
(where
two
vowels
occur
next
to
each
other
without
an
intervening
consonant).
Some
words
do
have
an
underlying
vowel
at
the
beginning
such
as
the
definite
article
al-
or
words
such
as
اشترا‎
ishtarā
he
bought
اجتماع‎
ijtimāʻ
meeting.
When
actually
pronounced
one
of
three
things
happens:

If
the
word
occurs
after
another
word
ending
in
a
consonant
there
is
a
smooth
transition
from
final
consonant
to
initial
vowel
e.g.
الاجتماع‎
al-ijtimāʻ
meeting
/alid͡ʒtimaːʕ/.
If
the
word
occurs
after
another
word
ending
in
a
vowel
the
initial
vowel
of
the
word
is
elided
e.g.
بيت
المدير‎
baytu
(a)l-mudīr
house
of
the
director
/bajtulmudiːr/.
If
the
word
occurs
at
the
beginning
of
an
utterance
a
glottal
stop
[ʔ]
is
added
onto
the
beginning
e.g.
البيت
هو‎
al-baytu
huwa
...
The
house
is
...
/ʔalbajtuhuwa
...
/.
Stress
Word
stress
is
not
phonemically
contrastive
in
Standard
Arabic.
It
bears
a
strong
relationship
to
vowel
length.
The
basic
rules
for
Modern
Standard
Arabic
are:

A
final
vowel
long
or
short
may
not
be
stressed.
Only
one
of
the
last
three
syllables
may
be
stressed.
Given
this
restriction
the
last
heavy
syllable
(containing
a
long
vowel
or
ending
in
a
consonant)
is
stressed
if
it
is
not
the
final
syllable.
If
the
final
syllable
is
super
heavy
and
closed
(of
the
form
CVVC
or
CVCC)
it
receives
stress.
If
no
syllable
is
heavy
or
super
heavy
the
first
possible
syllable
(i.e.
third
from
end)
is
stressed.
As
a
special
exception
in
Form
VII
and
VIII
verb
forms
stress
may
not
be
on
the
first
syllable
despite
the
above
rules:
Hence
inkatab(a)
he
subscribed
(whether
or
not
the
final
short
vowel
is
pronounced)
yankatib(u)
he
subscribes
(whether
or
not
the
final
short
vowel
is
pronounced)
yankatib
he
should
subscribe
(juss.).
Likewise
Form
VIII
ishtarā
he
bought
yashtarī
he
buys.
Examples:kitāb(un)
book
kā-ti-b(un)
writer
mak-ta-b(un)
desk
ma-kā-ti-b(u)

mak-ta-ba-tun

mak-ta-ba(-tun)
library
in

ka-ta-bū

they

fem)
wrote
ka-tab-tu
(Modern
Standard

I

(short
form
or
dialect).
Doubled
consonants
count
as
two
consonants:
ma-jal-la-(tan)
magazine
ma-ḥall(-un)
place.

These
rules
may
result
in
differently
stressed
syllables
when
final
case
endings
are
pronounced
vs.
the
normal
situation
where
they
are
not
pronounced
as
in
the
above
example
of
mak-ta-ba-tun
library
in
full
pronunciation
but
mak-ta-ba(-tun)
library
in
short
pronunciation.

The
restriction
on
final
long
vowels
does
not
apply
to
the
spoken
dialects
where
original
final
long
vowels
have
been
shortened
and
secondary
final
long
vowels
have
arisen
from
loss
of
original
final
-hu/hi.

Some
dialects
have
different
stress
rules.
In
the
Cairo
(Egyptian
Arabic)
dialect
a
heavy
syllable
may
not
carry
stress
more
than
two
syllables
from
the
end
of
a
word
hence
mad-ra-sah
school
qā-hi-rah
Cairo.
This
also
affects
the
way
that
Modern
Standard
Arabic
is
pronounced
in
Egypt.
In
the
Arabic
of
Sanaa
stress
is
often
retracted:
bay-tayn
two
houses
mā-sat-hum
their
table
ma-kā-tīb
desks
zā-rat-ḥīn
sometimes
mad-ra-sat-hum
their
school.
(In
this
dialect
only
syllables
with
long
vowels
or
diphthongs
are
considered
heavy;
in
a
two-syllable
word
the
final
syllable
can
be
stressed
only
if
the
preceding
syllable
is
light;
and
in
longer
words
the
final
syllable
cannot
be
stressed.)

Levels
of
pronunciation
The
final
short
vowels
(e.g.
the
case
endings
-a
-i
-u
and
mood
endings
-u
-a)
are
often
not
pronounced
in
this
language
despite
forming
part
of
the
formal
paradigm
of
nouns
and
verbs.
The
following
levels
of
pronunciation
exist:

Full
pronunciation
with
pausa
This
is
the
most
formal
level
actually
used
in
speech.
All
endings
are
pronounced
as
written
except
at
the
end
of
an
utterance
where
the
following
changes
occur:

Final
short
vowels
are
not
pronounced.
(But
possibly
an
exception
is
made
for
feminine
plural
-na
and
shortened
vowels
in
the
jussive/imperative
of
defective
verbs
e.g.
irmi
throw.)
The
entire
indefinite
noun
endings
-in
and
-un
(with
nunation)
are
left
off.
The
ending
-an
is
left
off
of
nouns
preceded
by
a
tāʾ
marbūṭah
ة
(i.e.
the
-t
in
the
ending
-at-
that
typically
marks
feminine
nouns)
but
pronounced
as
-ā
in
other
nouns
(hence
its
writing
in
this
fashion
in
the
Arabic
script).
The
tāʼ
marbūṭah
itself
(typically
of
feminine
nouns)
is
pronounced
as
h.
(At
least
this
is
the
case
in
extremely
formal
pronunciation
e.g.
some
Quranic
recitations.
In
practice
this
h
is
usually
omitted.)
Formal
short
pronunciation
This
is
a
formal
level
of
pronunciation
sometimes
seen.
It
is
somewhat
like
pronouncing
all
words
as
if
they
were
in
pausal
position
(with
influence
from
the
colloquial
varieties).
The
following
changes
occur:

Most
final
short
vowels
are
not
pronounced.
However
the
following
short
vowels
are
pronounced:
feminine
plural
-na
shortened
vowels
in
the
jussive/imperative
of
defective
verbs
e.g.
irmi
throw
second-person
singular
feminine
past-tense
-ti
and
likewise
anti
you
(fem.
sg.)
sometimes
first-person
singular
past-tense
-tu
sometimes
second-person
masculine
past-tense
-ta
and
likewise
anta
you
(masc.
sg.)
final
-a
in
certain
short
words
e.g.
laysa
is
not
sawfa
(future-tense
marker)
The
nunation
endings
-an
-in
-un
are
not
pronounced.
However
they
are
pronounced
in
adverbial
accusative
formations
e.g.
taqrīban
تَقْرِيبًا
almost
approximately
ʻādatan
عَادَةً
usually.
The
tāʾ
marbūṭah
ending
ة
is
unpronounced
except
in
construct
state
nouns
where
it
sounds
as
t
(and
in
adverbial
accusative
constructions
e.g.
ʻādatan
عَادَةً
usually
where
the
entire
-tan
is
pronounced).
The
masculine
singular
nisbah
ending
-iyy
is
actually
pronounced
-ī
and
is
unstressed
(but
plural
and
feminine
singular
forms
i.e.
when
followed
by
a
suffix
still
sound
as
-iyy-).
Full
endings
(including
case
endings)
occur
when
a
clitic
object
or
possessive
suffix
is
added
(e.g.
-nā
us/our).
Informal
short
pronunciation
This
is
the
pronunciation
used
by
speakers
of
Modern
Standard
Arabic
in
extemporaneous
speech
i.e.
when
producing
new
sentences
rather
than
simply
reading
a
prepared
text.
It
is
similar
to
formal
short
pronunciation
except
that
the
rules
for
dropping
final
vowels
apply
even
when
a
clitic
suffix
is
added.
Basically
short-vowel
case
and
mood
endings
are
never
pronounced
and
certain
other
changes
occur
that
echo
the
corresponding
colloquial
pronunciations.
Specifically:

All
the
rules
for
formal
short
pronunciation
apply
except
as
follows.
The
past
tense
singular
endings
written
formally
as
-tu
-ta
-ti
are
pronounced
-t
-t
-ti.
But
masculine
ʾanta
is
pronounced
in
full.
Unlike
in
formal
short
pronunciation
the
rules
for
dropping
or
modifying
final
endings
are
also
applied
when
a
clitic
object
or
possessive
suffix
is
added
(e.g.
-nā
us/our).
If
this
produces
a
sequence
of
three
consonants
then
one
of
the
following
happens
depending
on
the
speakers
native
colloquial
variety:
A
short
vowel
(e.g.
-i-
or
-ǝ-)
is
consistently
added
either
between
the
second
and
third
or
the
first
and
second
consonants.
Or
a
short
vowel
is
added
only
if
an
otherwise
unpronounceable
sequence
occurs
typically
due
to
a
violation
of
the
sonority
hierarchy
(e.g.
-rtn-
is
pronounced
as
a
three-consonant
cluster
but
-trn-
needs
to
be
broken
up).
Or
a
short
vowel
is
never
added
but
consonants
like
r
l
m
n
occurring
between
two
other
consonants
will
be
pronounced
as
a
syllabic
consonant
(as
in
the
English
words
butter
bottle
bottom
button).
When
a
doubled
consonant
occurs
before
another
consonant
(or
finally)
it
is
often
shortened
to
a
single
consonant
rather
than
a
vowel
added.
(However
Moroccan
Arabic
never
shortens
doubled
consonants
or
inserts
short
vowels
to
break
up
clusters
instead
tolerating
arbitrary-length
series
of
arbitrary
consonants
and
hence
Moroccan
Arabic
speakers
are
likely
to
follow
the
same
rules
in
their
pronunciation
of
Modern
Standard
Arabic.)
The
clitic
suffixes
themselves
tend
also
to
be
changed
in
a
way
that
avoids
many
possible
occurrences
of
three-consonant
clusters.
In
particular
-ka
-ki
-hu
generally
sound
as
-ak
-ik
-uh.
Final
long
vowels
are
often
shortened
merging
with
any
short
vowels
that
remain.
Depending
on
the
level
of
formality
the
speakers
education
level
etc.
various
grammatical
changes
may
occur
in
ways
that
echo
the
colloquial
variants:
Any
remaining
case
endings
(e.g.
masculine
plural
nominative
-ūn
vs.
oblique
-īn)
will
be
leveled
with
the
oblique
form
used
everywhere.
(However
in
words
like
ab
father
and
akh
brother
with
special
long-vowel
case
endings
in
the
construct
state
the
nominative
is
used
everywhere
hence
abū
father
of
akhū
brother
of.)
Feminine
plural
endings
in
verbs
and
clitic
suffixes
will
often
drop
out
with
the
masculine
plural
endings
used
instead.
If
the
speakers
native
variety
has
feminine
plural
endings
they
may
be
preserved
but
will
often
be
modified
in
the
direction
of
the
forms
used
in
the
speakers
native
variety
e.g.
-an
instead
of
-na.
Dual
endings
will
often
drop
out
except
on
nouns
and
then
used
only
for
emphasis
(similar
to
their
use
in
the
colloquial
varieties);
elsewhere
the
plural
endings
are
used
(or
feminine
singular
if
appropriate).

As
mentioned
above
many
spoken
dialects
have
a
process
of
emphasis
spreading
where
the
emphasis
(pharyngealization)
of
emphatic
consonants
spreads
forward
and
back
through
adjacent
syllables
pharyngealizing
all
nearby
consonants
and
triggering
the
back
allophone
[ɑ(ː)]
in
all
nearby
low
vowels.
The
extent
of
emphasis
spreading
varies.
For
example
in
Moroccan
Arabic
it
spreads
as
far
as
the
first
full
vowel
(i.e.
sound
derived
from
a
long
vowel
or
diphthong)
on
either
side;
in
many
Levantine
dialects
it
spreads
indefinitely
but
is
blocked
by
any
/j/
or
/ʃ/;
while
in
Egyptian
Arabic
it
usually
spreads
throughout
the
entire
word
including
prefixes
and
suffixes.
In
Moroccan
Arabic
/i
u/
also
have
emphatic
allophones
[e~ɛ]
and
[o~ɔ]
respectively.

Unstressed
short
vowels
especially
/i
u/
are
deleted
in
many
contexts.
Many
sporadic
examples
of
short
vowel
change
have
occurred
(especially
/a/→/i/
and
interchange
/i/↔/u/).
Most
Levantine
dialects
merge
short
/i
u/
into
/ə/
in
most
contexts
(all
except
directly
before
a
single
final
consonant).
In
Moroccan
Arabic
on
the
other
hand
short
/u/
triggers
labialization
of
nearby
consonants
(especially
velar
consonants
and
uvular
consonants)
and
then
short
/a
i
u/
all
merge
into
/ə/
which
is
deleted
in
many
contexts.
(The
labialization
plus
/ə/
is
sometimes
interpreted
as
an
underlying
phoneme
/ŭ/.)
This
essentially
causes
the
wholesale
loss
of
the
short-long
vowel
distinction
with
the
original
long
vowels
/aː
iː
uː/
remaining
as
half-long
[aˑ
iˑ
uˑ]
phonemically
/a
i
u/
which
are
used
to
represent
both
short
and
long
vowels
in
borrowings
from
Literary
Arabic.

Most
spoken
dialects
have
monophthongized
original
/aj
aw/
to
/eː
oː/
in
most
circumstances
including
adjacent
to
emphatic
consonants
while
keeping
them
as
the
original
diphthongs
in
others
e.g.
مَوْعِد‎
/mawʕid/.
In
most
of
the
Moroccan
Algerian
and
Tunisian
(except
Sahel
and
Southeastern)
Arabic
dialects
they
have
subsequently
merged
into
original
/iː
uː/.

Consonants
In
most
dialects
there
may
be
more
or
fewer
phonemes
than
those
listed
in
the
chart
above.
For
example
[g]
is
considered
a
native
phoneme
in
most
Arabic
dialects
except
in
Levantine
dialects
like
Syrian
or
Lebanese
where
ج‎
is
pronounced
[ʒ]
and
ق‎
is
pronounced
[ʔ].
[d͡ʒ]
or
[ʒ]
(ج‎)
is
considered
a
native
phoneme
in
most
dialects
except
in
Egyptian
and
a
number
of
Yemeni
and
Omani
dialects
where
ج‎
is
pronounced
[g].
[zˤ]
or
[ðˤ]
and
[dˤ]
are
distinguished
in
the
dialects
of
Egypt
Sudan
the
Levant
and
the
Hejaz
but
they
have
merged
as
[ðˤ]
in
most
dialects
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula
Iraq
and
Tunisia
and
have
merged
as
[dˤ]
in
Morocco
and
Algeria.
The
usage
of
non-native
[p]
پ‎
and
[v]
ڤ‎
depends
on
the
usage
of
each
speaker
but
they
might
be
more
prevalent
in
some
dialects
than
others.
The
Iraqi
and
Gulf
Arabic
also
has
the
sound
[t͡ʃ]
and
writes
it
and
[ɡ]
with
the
Persian
letters
چ
and
گ
as
in
گوجة
gawjah
plum;
چمة
chimah
truffle.

Early
in
the
expansion
of
Arabic
the
separate
emphatic
phonemes
[ɮˤ]
and
[ðˤ]
coalesced
into
a
single
phoneme
[ðˤ].
Many
dialects
(such
as
Egyptian
Levantine
and
much
of
the
Maghreb)
subsequently
lost
interdental
fricatives
converting
[θ
ð
ðˤ]
into
[t
d
dˤ].
Most
dialects
borrow
learned
words
from
the
Standard
language
using
the
same
pronunciation
as
for
inherited
words
but
some
dialects
without
interdental
fricatives
(particularly
in
Egypt
and
the
Levant)
render
original
[θ
ð
ðˤ
dˤ]
in
borrowed
words
as
[s
z
zˤ
dˤ].

Another
key
distinguishing
mark
of
Arabic
dialects
is
how
they
render
the
original
velar
and
uvular
plosives
/q/
/d͡ʒ/
(Proto-Semitic
/ɡ/)
and
/k/:

ق‎
/q/
retains
its
original
pronunciation
in
widely
scattered
regions
such
as
Yemen
Morocco
and
urban
areas
of
the
Maghreb.
It
is
pronounced
as
a
glottal
stop
[ʔ]
in
several
prestige
dialects
such
as
those
spoken
in
Cairo
Beirut
and
Damascus.
But
it
is
rendered
as
a
voiced
velar
plosive
[ɡ]
in
Persian
Gulf
Upper
Egypt
parts
of
the
Maghreb
and
less
urban
parts
of
the
Levant
(e.g.
Jordan).
In
Iraqi
Arabic
it
sometimes
retains
its
original
pronunciation
and
is
sometimes
rendered
as
a
voiced
velar
plosive
depending
on
the
word.
Some
traditionally
Christian
villages
in
rural
areas
of
the
Levant
render
the
sound
as
[k]
as
do
Shiʻi
Bahrainis.
In
some
Gulf
dialects
it
is
palatalized
to
[d͡ʒ]
or
[ʒ].
It
is
pronounced
as
a
voiced
uvular
constrictive
[ʁ]
in
Sudanese
Arabic.
Many
dialects
with
a
modified
pronunciation
for
/q/
maintain
the
[q]
pronunciation
in
certain
words
(often
with
religious
or
educational
overtones)
borrowed
from
the
Classical
language.
ج‎
/d͡ʒ/
is
pronounced
as
an
affricate
in
Iraq
and
much
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula
but
is
pronounced
[ɡ]
in
most
of
North
Egypt
and
parts
of
Yemen
and
Oman
[ʒ]
in
Morocco
Tunisia
and
the
Levant
and
[j]
[i̠]
in
most
words
in
much
of
the
Persian
Gulf.
ك‎
/k/
usually
retains
its
original
pronunciation
but
is
palatalized
to
/t͡ʃ/
in
many
words
in
Israel
and
the
Palestinian
Territories
Iraq
and
countries
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula.
Often
a
distinction
is
made
between
the
suffixes
/-ak/
(you
masc.)
and
/-ik/
(you
fem.)
which
become
/-ak/
and
/-it͡ʃ/
respectively.
In
Sanaa
Omani
and
Bahrani
/-ik/
is
pronounced
/-iʃ/.
Pharyngealization
of
the
emphatic
consonants
tends
to
weaken
in
many
of
the
spoken
varieties
and
to
spread
from
emphatic
consonants
to
nearby
sounds.
In
addition
the
emphatic
allophone
[ɑ]
automatically
triggers
pharyngealization
of
adjacent
sounds
in
many
dialects.
As
a
result
it
may
difficult
or
impossible
to
determine
whether
a
given
coronal
consonant
is
phonemically
emphatic
or
not
especially
in
dialects
with
long-distance
emphasis
spreading.
(A
notable
exception
is
the
sounds
/t/
vs.
/tˤ/
in
Moroccan
Arabic
because
the
former
is
pronounced
as
an
affricate
[t͡s]
but
the
latter
is
not.)

Grammar

Examples
of
how
the
Arabic
root
and
form
system
works
Main

Arabic
grammar
Literary
Arabic
Main
article:
Modern
Standard
Arabic
As
in
other
Semitic
languages
Arabic
has
a
complex
and
unusual
morphology
(i.e.
method
of
constructing
words
from
a
basic
root).
Arabic
has
a
nonconcatenative
root-and-pattern
morphology:
A
root
consists
of
a
set
of
bare
consonants
(usually
three)
which
are
fitted
into
a
discontinuous
pattern
to
form
words.
For
example
the
word
for
I
wrote
is
constructed
by
combining
the
root
k-t-b
write
with
the
pattern
-a-a-tu
I
Xed
to
form
katabtu
I
wrote.
Other
verbs
meaning
I
Xed
will
typically
have
the
same
pattern
but
with
different
consonants
e.g.
qaraʼtu
I
read
akaltu
I
ate
dhahabtu
I
went
although
other
patterns
are
possible
(e.g.
sharibtu
I
drank
qultu
I
said
takallamtu
I
spoke
where
the
subpattern
used
to
signal
the
past
tense
may
change
but
the
suffix
-tu
is
always
used).

From
a
single
root
k-t-b
numerous
words
can
be
formed
by
applying
different
patterns:

كَتَبْتُ
katabtu
I
wrote
كَتَّبْتُ
kattabtu
I
had
(something)
written
كَاتَبْتُ
kātabtu
I
corresponded
(with
someone)
أَكْتَبْتُ
aktabtu
I
dictated
اِكْتَتَبْتُ
iktatabtu
I
subscribed
تَكَاتَبْنَا
takātabnā
we
corresponded
with
each
other
أَكْتُبُ
aktubu
I
write
أُكَتِّبُ
ukattibu
I
have
(something)
written
أُكَاتِبُ

etc.
Nouns
and
adjectives
Nouns
in
Literary
Arabic
have
three
grammatical
cases
(nominative
accusative
and
genitive
[also
used
when
the
noun
is
governed
by
a
preposition]);
three
numbers
(singular
dual
and
plural);
two
genders
(masculine
and
feminine);
and
three
states
(indefinite
definite
and
construct).
The
cases
of
singular
nouns
(other
than
those
that
end
in
long
ā)
are
indicated
by
suffixed
short
vowels
(/-u/
for
nominative
/-a/
for
accusative
/-i/
for
genitive).

The
feminine
singular
is
often
marked
by
ـَة
/-at/
which
is
pronounced
as
/-ah/
before
a
pause.
Plural
is
indicated
either
through
endings
(the
sound
plural)
or
internal
modification
(the
broken
plural).
Definite
nouns
include
all
proper
nouns
all
nouns
in
construct
state
and
all
nouns
which
are
prefixed
by
the
definite
article
اَلْـ
/al-/.
Indefinite
singular
nouns
(other
than
those
that
end
in
long
ā)
add
a
final
/-n/
to
the
case-marking
vowels
giving
/-un/
/-an/
or
/-in/
(which
is
also
referred
to
as
nunation
or
tanwīn).

Adjectives
in
Literary
Arabic
are
marked
for
case
number
gender
and
state
as
for
nouns.
However
the
plural
of
all
non-human
nouns
is
always
combined
with
a
singular
feminine
adjective
which
takes
the
ـَة
/-at/
suffix.

Pronouns
in
Literary
Arabic
are
marked
for
person
number
and
gender.
There
are
two
varieties
independent
pronouns
and
enclitics.
Enclitic
pronouns
are
attached
to
the
end
of
a
verb
noun
or
preposition
and
indicate
verbal
and
prepositional
objects
or
possession
of
nouns.
The
first-person
singular
pronoun
has
a
different
enclitic
form
used
for
verbs
(ـنِي
/-nī/)
and
for
nouns
or
prepositions
(ـِي
/-ī/
after
consonants
ـيَ
/-ya/
after
vowels).

Nouns
verbs
pronouns
and
adjectives
agree
with
each
other
in
all
respects.
However
non-human
plural
nouns
are
grammatically
considered
to
be
feminine
singular.
Furthermore
a
verb
in
a
verb-initial
sentence
is
marked
as
singular
regardless
of
its
semantic
number
when
the
subject
of
the
verb
is
explicitly
mentioned
as
a
noun.
Numerals
between
three
and
ten
show
chiasmic
agreement
in
that
grammatically
masculine
numerals
have
feminine
marking
and
vice
versa.

Verbs
Further
information:
Arabic
verbs
Verbs
in
Literary
Arabic
are
marked
for
person
(first
second
or
third)
gender
and
number.
They
are
conjugated
in
two
major
paradigms
(past
and
non-past);
two
voices
(active
and
passive);
and
six
moods
(indicative
imperative
subjunctive
jussive
shorter
energetic
and
longer
energetic)
the
fifth
and
sixth
moods
the
energetics
exist
only
in
Classical
Arabic
but
not
in
MSA.[91]
There
are
also
two
participles
(active
and
passive)
and
a
verbal
noun
but
no
infinitive.

The
past
and
non-past
paradigms
are
sometimes
also
termed
perfective
and
imperfective
indicating
the
fact
that
they
actually
represent
a
combination
of
tense
and
aspect.
The
moods
other
than
the
indicative
occur
only
in
the
non-past
and
the
future
tense
is
signaled
by
prefixing
سَـ
sa-
or
سَوْفَ
sawfa
onto
the
non-past.
The
past
and
non-past
differ
in
the
form
of
the
stem
(e.g.
past
كَتَبـkatab-
vs.
non-past
ـكْتُبـ
-ktub-)
and
also
use
completely
different
sets
of
affixes
for
indicating
person
number
and
gender:
In
the
past
the
person
number
and
gender
are
fused
into
a
single
suffixal
morpheme
while
in
the
non-past
a
combination
of
prefixes
(primarily
encoding
person)
and
suffixes
(primarily
encoding
gender
and
number)
are
used.
The
passive
voice
uses
the
same
person/number/gender
affixes
but
changes
the
vowels
of
the
stem.

The
following
shows
a
paradigm
of
a
regular
Arabic
verb
كَتَبَ
kataba
to
write.
In
Modern
Standard
the
energetic
mood
(in
either
long
or
short
form
which
have
the
same
meaning)
is
almost
never
used.

Derivation
Like
other
Semitic
languages
and
unlike
most
other
languages
Arabic
makes
much
more
use
of
nonconcatenative
morphology
(applying
many
templates
applied
roots)
to
derive
words
than
adding
prefixes
or
suffixes
to
words.

For
verbs
a
given
root
can
occur
in
many
different
derived
verb
stems
(of
which
there
are
about
fifteen)
each
with
one
or
more
characteristic
meanings
and
each
with
its
own
templates
for
the
past
and
non-past
stems
active
and
passive
participles
and
verbal
noun.
These
are
referred
to
by
Western
scholars
as
Form
I
Form
II
and
so
on
through
Form
XV
(although
Forms
XI
to
XV
are
rare).
These
stems
encode
grammatical
functions
such
as
the
causative
intensive
and
reflexive.
Stems
sharing
the
same
root
consonants
represent
separate
verbs
albeit
often
semantically
related
and
each
is
the
basis
for
its
own
conjugational
paradigm.
As
a
result
these
derived
stems
are
part
of
the
system
of
derivational
morphology
not
part
of
the
inflectional
system.

Form
II
is
sometimes
used
to
create
transitive
denominative
verbs
(verbs
built
from
nouns);
Form
V
is
the
equivalent
used
for
intransitive
denominatives.

The
associated
participles
and
verbal
nouns
of
a
verb
are
the
primary
means
of
forming
new
lexical
nouns
in
Arabic.
This
is
similar
to
the
process
by
which
for
example
the
English
gerund
meeting
(similar
to
a
verbal
noun)
has
turned
into
a
noun
referring
to
a
particular
type
of
social
often
work-related
event
where
people
gather
together
to
have
a
discussion
(another
lexicalized
verbal
noun).
Another
fairly
common
means
of
forming
nouns
is
through
one
of
a
limited
number
of
patterns
that
can
be
applied
directly
to
roots
such
as
the
nouns
of
location
in
ma-
(e.g.
maktab
desk
office

k-t-b
write
maṭbakh
kitchen

ṭ-b-kh
cook).

The
only
three
genuine
suffixes
are
as
follows:

The
feminine
suffix
-ah;
variously
derives
terms
for
women
from
related
terms
for
men
or
more
generally
terms
along
the
same
lines
as
the
corresponding
masculine
e.g.
maktabah
library
(also
a
writing-related
place
but
different
from
maktab
as
above).
The
nisbah
suffix
-iyy-.
This
suffix
is
extremely
productive
and
forms
adjectives
meaning
related
to
X.
It
corresponds
to
English
adjectives
in
-ic
-al
-an
-y
-ist
etc.
The
feminine
nisbah
suffix
-iyyah.
This
is
formed
by
adding
the
feminine
suffix
-ah
onto
nisba
adjectives
to
form
abstract
nouns.
For
example
from
the
basic
root
sh-r-k
share
can
be
derived
the
Form
VIII
verb
ishtaraka
to
cooperate
participate
and
in
turn
its
verbal
noun
ishtirāk
cooperation
participation
can
be
formed.
This
in
turn
can
be
made
into
a
nisbah
adjective
ishtirākī
socialist
from
which
an
abstract
noun
ishtirākiyyah
socialism
can
be
derived.
Other
recent
formations
are
jumhūriyyah
republic
(lit.
public-ness

jumhūr
multitude
general
public)
and
the
Gaddafi-specific
variation
jamāhīriyyah
peoples
republic
(lit.
masses-ness

jamāhīr
the
masses
pl.
of
jumhūr
as
above).
Colloquial
varieties
Main
article:
Varieties
of
Arabic
The
spoken
dialects
have
lost
the
case
distinctions
and
make
only
limited
use
of
the
dual
(it
occurs
only
on
nouns
and
its
use
is
no
longer
required
in
all
circumstances).
They
have
lost
the
mood
distinctions
other
than
imperative
but
many
have
since
gained
new
moods
through
the
use
of
prefixes
(most
often
/bi-/
for
indicative
vs.
unmarked
subjunctive).
They
have
also
mostly
lost
the
indefinite
nunation
and
the
internal
passive.

Arabic
alphabet

Arabic
Braille

Arabic
calligraphy
written
by
a
Malay
Muslim
in
Malaysia.
The
calligrapher
is
making
a
rough
draft.
The
Arabic
alphabet
derives
from
the
Aramaic
through
Nabatean
to
which
it
bears
a
loose
resemblance
like
that
of
Coptic
or
Cyrillic
scripts
to
Greek
script.
Traditionally
there
were
several
differences
between
the
Western
(North
African)
and
Middle
Eastern
versions
of
the
alphabet—in
particular
the
faʼ
had
a
dot
underneath
and
qaf
a
single
dot
above
in
the
Maghreb
and
the
order
of
the
letters
was
slightly
different
(at
least
when
they
were
used
as
numerals).

However
the
old
Maghrebi
variant
has
been
abandoned
except
for
calligraphic
purposes
in
the
Maghreb
itself
and
remains
in
use
mainly
in
the
Quranic
schools
(zaouias)
of
West
Africa.
Arabic
like
all
other
Semitic
languages
(except
for
the
Latin-written
Maltese
and
the
languages
with
the
Geez
script)
is
written
from
right
to
left.
There
are
several
styles
of
scripts
such
as
thuluth
muhaqqaq
tawqi
rayhan
and
notably
naskh
which
is
used
in
print
and
by
computers
and
ruqʻah
which
is
commonly
used
for
correspondence.[92][93]

Originally
Arabic
was
made
up
of
only
rasm
without
diacritical
marks[94]
Later
diacritical
points
(which
in
Arabic
are
referred
to
as
nuqaṯ)
were
added
(which
allowed
readers
to
distinguish
between
letters
such
as
b
t
th
n
and
y).
Finally
signs
known
as
Tashkil
were
used
for
short
vowels
known
as
harakat
and
other
uses
such
as
final
postnasalized
or
long
vowels.

Calligraphy
Main
article:
Arabic
calligraphy
After
Khalil
ibn
Ahmad
al
Farahidi
finally
fixed
the
Arabic
script
around
786
many
styles
were
developed
both
for
the
writing
down
of
the
Quran
and
other
books
and
for
inscriptions
on
monuments
as
decoration.

Arabic
calligraphy
has
not
fallen
out
of
use
as
calligraphy
has
in
the
Western
world
and
is
still
considered
by
Arabs
as
a
major
art
form;
calligraphers
are
held
in
great
esteem.
Being
cursive
by
nature
unlike
the
Latin
script
Arabic
script
is
used
to
write
down
a
verse
of
the
Quran
a
hadith
or
simply
a
proverb.
The
composition
is
often
abstract
but
sometimes
the
writing
is
shaped
into
an
actual
form
such
as
that
of
an
animal.
One
of
the
current
masters
of
the
genre
is
Hassan
Massoudy.

In
modern
times
the
intrinsically
calligraphic
nature
of
the
written
Arabic
form
is
haunted
by
the
thought
that
a
typographic
approach
to
the
language
necessary
for
digitized
unification
will
not
always
accurately
maintain
meanings
conveyed
through
calligraphy.[95]

There
are
a
number
of
different
standards
for
the
romanization
of
Arabic
i.e.
methods
of
accurately
and
efficiently
representing
Arabic
with
the
Latin
script.
There
are
various
conflicting
motivations
involved
which
leads
to
multiple
systems.
Some
are
interested
in
transliteration
i.e.
representing
the
spelling
of
Arabic
while
others
focus
on
transcription
i.e.
representing
the
pronunciation
of
Arabic.
(They
differ
in
that
for
example
the
same
letter
ي‎
is
used
to
represent
both
a
consonant
as
in
you
or
yet
and
a
vowel
as
in
me
or
eat.)
Some
systems
e.g.
for
scholarly
use
are
intended
to
accurately
and
unambiguously
represent
the
phonemes
of
Arabic
generally
making
the
phonetics
more
explicit
than
the
original
word
in
the
Arabic
script.
These
systems
are
heavily
reliant
on
diacritical
marks
such
as
š
for
the
sound
equivalently
written
sh
in
English.
Other
systems
(e.g.
the
Baháí
orthography)
are
intended
to
help
readers
who
are
neither
Arabic
speakers
nor
linguists
with
intuitive
pronunciation
of
Arabic
names
and
phrases.[citation
needed]
These
less
scientific
systems
tend
to
avoid
diacritics
and
use
digraphs
(like
sh
and
kh).
These
are
usually
simpler
to
read
but
sacrifice
the
definiteness
of
the
scientific
systems
and
may
lead
to
ambiguities
e.g.
whether
to
interpret
sh
as
a
single
sound
as
in
gash
or
a
combination
of
two
sounds
as
in
gashouse.
The
ALA-LC
romanization
solves
this
problem
by
separating
the
two
sounds
with
a
prime
symbol
(
′
);
e.g.
as′hal
easier.

During
the
last
few
decades
and
especially
since
the
1990s
Western-invented
text
communication
technologies
have
become
prevalent
in
the
Arab
world
such
as
personal
computers
the
World
Wide
Web
email
bulletin
board
systems
IRC
instant
messaging
and
mobile
phone
text
messaging.
Most
of
these
technologies
originally
had
the
ability
to
communicate
using
the
Latin
script
only
and
some
of
them
still
do
not
have
the
Arabic
script
as
an
optional
feature.
As
a
result
Arabic
speaking
users
communicated
in
these
technologies
by
transliterating
the
Arabic
text
using
the
Latin
script
sometimes
known
as
IM
Arabic.

To
handle
those
Arabic
letters
that
cannot
be
accurately
represented
using
the
Latin
script
numerals
and
other
characters
were
appropriated.
For
example
the
numeral
3
may
be
used
to
represent
the
Arabic
letter
⟨ع‎⟩.
There
is
no
universal
name
for
this
type
of
transliteration
but
some
have
named
it
Arabic
Chat
Alphabet.
Other
systems
of
transliteration
exist
such
as
using
dots
or
capitalization
to
represent
the
emphatic
counterparts
of
certain
consonants.
For
instance
using
capitalization
the
letter
⟨د‎⟩
may
be
represented
by
d.
Its
emphatic
counterpart
⟨ض‎⟩
may
be
written
as
D.

Numerals
In
most
of
present-day
North
Africa
the
Western
Arabic
numerals
(0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9)
are
used.
However
in
Egypt
and
Arabic-speaking
countries
to
the
east
of
it
the
Eastern
Arabic
numerals
(٠‎
–
١‎
–
٢‎
–
٣‎
–
٤‎
–
٥‎
–
٦‎
–
٧‎
–
٨‎
–
٩‎)
are
in
use.
When
representing
a
number
in
Arabic
the
lowest-valued
position
is
placed
on
the
right
so
the
order
of
positions
is
the
same
as
in
left-to-right
scripts.
Sequences
of
digits
such
as
telephone
numbers
are
read
from
left
to
right
but
numbers
are
spoken
in
the
traditional
Arabic
fashion
with
units
and
tens
reversed
from
the
modern
English
usage.
For
example
24
is
said
four
and
twenty
just
like
in
the
German
language
(vierundzwanzig)
and
Classical
Hebrew
and
1975
is
said
a
thousand
and
nine-hundred
and
five
and
seventy
or
more
eloquently
a
thousand
and
nine-hundred
five
seventy

As
a
foreign
language
Arabic
has
been
taught
worldwide
in
many
elementary
and
secondary
schools
especially
Muslim
schools.
Universities
around
the
world
have
classes
that
teach
Arabic
as
part
of
their
foreign
languages
Middle
Eastern
studies
and
religious
studies
courses.
Arabic
language
schools
exist
to
assist
students
to
learn
Arabic
outside
the
academic
world.
There
are
many
Arabic
language
schools
in
the
Arab
world
and
other
Muslim
countries.
Because
the
Quran
is
written
in
Arabic
and
all
Islamic
terms
are
in
Arabic
millions[96]
of
Muslims
(both
Arab
and
non-Arab)
study
the
language.
Software
and
books
with
tapes
are
also
important
part
of
Arabic
learning
as
many
of
Arabic
learners
may
live
in
places
where
there
are
no
academic
or
Arabic
language
school
classes
available.
Radio
series
of
Arabic
language
classes
are
also
provided
from
some
radio
stations.[97]
A
number
of
websites
on
the
Internet
provide
online
classes
for
all

as
a
means
of
distance
education;
most
teach
Modern

some
teach
regional

from
numerous

Status
in
the
Arab
world
vs.
other
languages
With
the
sole
example
of
Medieval
linguist
Abu
Hayyan
al-Gharnati
–
who
while
a
scholar
of
the
Arabic
language
was
not
ethnically
Arab
–
Medieval
scholars
of
the
Arabic
language
made
no
efforts
at
studying
comparative
linguistics
considering
all
other
languages
inferior.[99]

In
modern
times
the
educated
upper
classes
in
the
Arab
world
have
taken
a
nearly
opposite
view.
Yasir
Suleiman
wrote
in
2011
that
studying
and
knowing
English
or
French
in
most
of
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa
have
become
a
badge
of
sophistication
and
modernity
and
...
feigning
or
asserting
weakness
or
lack
of
facility
in
Arabic
is
sometimes
paraded
as
a
sign
of
status
class
and
perversely
even
education
through
a
mélange
of
code-switching
practises.[100]

Originally
Maltese
was
an
Arabic
dialect
but
it
was
immediately
exposed
to
Latinisation
because
the
Normans
conquered
the
islands
in
1090
while
Christianisation
which
was
complete
by
1250
cut
off
the
dialect
from
contact
with
Classical
Arabic.
Consequently
Maltese
developed
on
its
own
slowly
but
steadily
absorbing
new
words
from
Sicilian
and
Italian
according
to
the
needs
of
the
developing
