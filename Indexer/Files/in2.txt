after the period of coloni in egypt,egyptian were look for a wai to reclaim and re-emphas egyptian cultur.as a result,some egyptian push for an egyptian of the arab languag in which the formal arab and the colloqui arab would be combin into on languag and the latin alphabet would be us.there wa also the idea of find a wai to us hieroglyph instead of the latin alphabet,but thi wa seen as too complic to us.a scholar,salama musa agre with the idea of appli a latin alphabet to arab,as he believ that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west.he also believ that latin script wa kei to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advanc in scienc and technolog.thi chang in alphabet,he believ,would solv the problem inher with arab,such as a lack of written vowel and difficulti write foreign word that made it difficult for non-nativ speaker to learn.ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi,two egyptian intellectu,agre with musa and support the push for roman.the idea that roman wa necessari for modern and growth in egypt continu with abd al-aziz fahmi in he wa the chairman for the write and grammar committe for the arab languag academi of cairo.howev,thi effort fail as the egyptian peopl felt a strong cultur tie to the arab alphabet.in particular,the older egyptian gener believ that the arab alphabet had strong connect to arab valu and histori,due to the long histori of the arab alphabet shrivtiel,in muslim societi.the languag of the quran and it influenc on poetri
the quran introduc a new wai of write to the world.peopl began studi and appli the uniqu style thei learn from the quran to not onli their own write,but also their cultur.writer studi the uniqu structur and format of the quran in order to identifi and appli the figur devic and their impact on the reader.quran's figur devic
the quran inspir music in poetri through the intern rhythm of the vers.the arrang of word,how certain sound creat harmoni,and the agreement of rhyme creat the sens of rhythm within each vers.at time,the chapter of the quran onli have the rhythm in common.the repetit in the quran introduc the true power and impact repetit can have in poetri.the repetit of certain word and phrase made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran.the quran us constant metaphor of blind and deaf to impli unbelief.metaphor were not a new concept to poetri,howev the strength of extend metaphor wa.the explicit imageri in the quran inspir mani poet to includ and focu on the featur in their own work.the poet ibn al-mu'tazz wrote a book regard the figur of speech inspir by hi studi of the quran.poet such as badr shakir al sayyab express hi polit opinion in hi work through imageri inspir by the form of more harsher imageri us in the quran.the quran us figur devic in order to express the mean in the most beauti form possibl.the studi of the paus in the quran as well as other rhetor allow it to be approach in a multipl wai.structur
although the quran is known for it fluenci and harmoni,the structur can be best describ as not alwai be inher chronolog,but can also flow themat instead the chapter in the quran have segment that flow in chronolog order,howev segment can transit into other segment not relat in chronolog,but could be relat in topic)the sura,also known as chapter of the quran,ar not place in chronolog order.the onli constant in their structur is that the longest ar place first and shorter on follow.the topic discuss in the chapter can also have no direct relat to each other as seen in mani sura)and can share in their sens of rhyme.the quran introduc to poetri the idea of abandon order and scatter narr throughout the text.harmoni is also present in the sound of the quran.the elong and accent present in the quran creat a harmoni flow within the write.uniqu sound of the quran recit,due to the accent,creat a deeper level of understand through a deeper emot connect.the quran is written in a languag that is simpl and understand by peopl.the simplic of the write inspir later poet to write in a more clear and clear-cut style.the word of the quran,although unchang,ar to thi dai understand and frequent us in both formal and inform arab.the simplic of the languag make memor and recit the quran a slightli easier task.cultur and the quran
the writer al-khattabi explain how cultur is a requir element to creat a sens of art in work as well as understand it.he believ that the fluenci and harmoni which the quran possess ar not the onli element that make it beauti and creat a bond between the reader and the text.while a lot of poetri wa deem compar to the quran in that it is equal to or better than the composit of the quran,a debat rose that such statement ar not possibl becaus human ar incap of compos work compar to the quran.becaus the structur of the quran made it difficult for a clear timelin to be seen,hadith were the main sourc of chronolog order.the hadith were pass down from gener to gener and thi tradit becam a larg resourc for understand the context.poetri after the quran began possess thi element of tradit by includ ambigu and background inform to be requir to understand the mean.after the quran came down to the peopl,the tradit of memor the vers becam present.it is believ that the greater the amount of the quran memor,the greater the faith.as technolog improv over time,hear recit of the quran becam more avail as well as more tool to help memor the vers.the tradit of love poetri serv as a symbol represent of a muslim's desir for a closer contact with their lord.while the influenc of the quran on arab poetri is explain and defend by numer writer,some writer such as al-baqillani believ that poetri and the quran ar in no conceiv wai relat due to the uniqu of the quran.poetri's imperfect prove hi point that thei cannot be compar with the fluenci the quran hold.arab and islam
classic arab is the languag of poetri and literatur includ new)it is also mainli the languag of the quran.classic arab is close associ with the religion of islam becaus the quran wa written in it.most of the world's muslim do not speak classic arab as their nativ languag,but mani can read the quran script and recit the quran.among non-arab muslim,translat of the quran ar most often accompani by the origin text.at present,modern standard arab msa)is also us in modern version of literari form of the quran.some muslim present a monogenesi of languag and claim that the arab languag wa the languag reveal by god for the benefit of mankind and the origin languag as a prototyp system of symbol commun,base upon it system of triconsonant root,spoken by man from which all other languag were deriv,have first been corrupt.judaism ha a similar account with the tower of babel.dialect and descend
