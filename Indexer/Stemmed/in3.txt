approxim			l	(ɫ)	j	w			
the phonem /d͡ʒ/ is repres by the arab letter jīm (ج‎) and ha mani standard pronunci. [d͡ʒ] is characterist of north algeria, iraq, and most of the arabian peninsula but with an allophon [ʒ] in some posit; [ʒ] occur in most of the levant and most of north africa; and [ɡ] is us in most of egypt and some region in yemen and oman. gener thi correspond with the pronunci in the colloqui dialect.[87] in some region in sudan and yemen, as well as in some sudanes and yemeni dialect, it mai be either [ɡʲ] or [ɟ], repres the origin pronunci of classic arab. foreign word contain /ɡ/ mai be transcrib with ج‎, غ‎, ك‎, ق‎, گ‎, ݣ‎ or ڨ‎, mainli depend on the region spoken varieti of arab or the commonli diacritic arab letter. in northern egypt, where the arab letter jīm (ج‎) is normal pronounc [ɡ], a separ phonem /ʒ/, which mai be transcrib with چ‎, occur in a small number of mostli non-arab loanword, e.g., /ʒakitta/ 'jacket'.

/θ/ (ث‎) can be pronounc as [s]. in some place of maghreb it can be also pronounc as [t͡s].

/x/ and /ɣ/ (خ,‎ غ‎) ar velar, post-velar, or uvular.[88]

in mani varieti, /ħ, ʕ/ (ح,‎ ع‎) ar epiglott [ʜ, ʢ] in western asia.

/l/ is pronounc as velar [ɫ] in الله /ʔallaːh/, the name of god, q.e. allah, when the word follow a, ā, u or ū (after i or ī it is unvelar: بسم الله‎ bismi l–lāh /bismillaːh/). some speaker velar other occurr of /l/ in msa, in imit of their spoken dialect.

the emphat conson /dˤ/ wa actual pronounc [ɮˤ], or possibl [d͡ɮˤ][89]—either wai, a highli unusu sound. the mediev arab actual term their languag lughat al-ḍād 'the languag of the ḍād' (the name of the letter us for thi sound), sinc thei thought the sound wa uniqu to their languag. (in fact, it also exist in a few other minor semit languag, e.g., mehri.)

arab ha conson tradition term "emphat" /tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ/ (ط,‎ ض,‎ ص,‎ ظ‎), which exhibit simultan pharyng [tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ] as well as vari degre of velar [tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ] (depend on the region), so thei mai be written with the "velar or pharyng" diacrit ( ̴) as: /t̴, d̴, s̴, ð̴/. thi simultan articul is describ as "retract tongu root" by phonologist.[90] in some transcript system, emphasi is shown by capit the letter, for exampl, /dˤ/ is written ⟨d⟩; in other the letter is underlin or ha a dot below it, for exampl, ⟨ḍ⟩.

vowel and conson can be phonolog short or long. long (gemin) conson ar normal written doubl in latin transcript (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflect the presenc of the arab diacrit mark shaddah, which indic doubl conson. in actual pronunci, doubl conson ar held twice as long as short conson. thi conson lengthen is phonem contrast: قبل‎ qabila 'he accept' vs. قبّل‎ qabbala 'he kiss'.

syllabl structur
arab ha two kind of syllabl: open syllabl (cv) and (cvv)—and close syllabl (cvc), (cvvc) and (cvcc). the syllabl type with two mora (unit of time), i.e. cvc and cvv, ar term heavi syllabl, while those with three mora, i.e. cvvc and cvcc, ar superheavi syllabl. superheavi syllabl in classic arab occur in onli two place: at the end of the sentenc (due to pausal pronunci) and in word such as حارّ‎ ḥārr 'hot', مادّة‎ māddah 'stuff, substanc', تحاجوا‎ taḥājjū 'thei disput with each other', where a long ā occur befor two ident conson (a former short vowel between the conson ha been lost). (in less formal pronunci of modern standard arab, superheavi syllabl ar common at the end of word or befor clitic suffix such as -nā 'us, our', due to the delet of final short vowel.)

in surfac pronunci, everi vowel must be preced by a conson (which mai includ the glottal stop [ʔ]). there ar no case of hiatu within a word (where two vowel occur next to each other, without an interven conson). some word do have an underli vowel at the begin, such as the definit articl al- or word such as اشترا‎ ishtarā 'he bought', اجتماع‎ ijtimāʻ 'meet'. when actual pronounc, on of three thing happen:

if the word occur after anoth word end in a conson, there is a smooth transit from final conson to initi vowel, e.g., الاجتماع‎ al-ijtimāʻ 'meet' /alid͡ʒtimaːʕ/.
if the word occur after anoth word end in a vowel, the initi vowel of the word is elid, e.g., بيت المدير‎ baytu (a)l-mudīr 'hous of the director' /bajtulmudiːr/.
if the word occur at the begin of an utter, a glottal stop [ʔ] is ad onto the begin, e.g., البيت هو‎ al-baytu huwa ... 'the hous is ...' /ʔalbajtuhuwa ... /.
stress
word stress is not phonem contrast in standard arab. it bear a strong relationship to vowel length. the basic rule for modern standard arab ar:

a final vowel, long or short, mai not be stress.
onli on of the last three syllabl mai be stress.
given thi restrict, the last heavi syllabl (contain a long vowel or end in a conson) is stress, if it is not the final syllabl.
if the final syllabl is super heavi and close (of the form cvvc or cvcc) it receiv stress.
if no syllabl is heavi or super heavi, the first possibl syllabl (i.e. third from end) is stress.
as a special except, in form vii and viii verb form stress mai not be on the first syllabl, despit the abov rule: henc inkatab(a) 'he subscrib' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounc), yankatib(u) 'he subscrib' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounc), yankatib 'he should subscrib (juss.)'. likewis form viii ishtarā 'he bought', yashtarī 'he bui'.
exampl:kitāb(un) 'book', kā-ti-b(un) 'writer', mak-ta-b(un) 'desk', ma-kā-ti-b(u) 'desk', mak-ta-ba-tun 'librari' (but mak-ta-ba(-tun) 'librari' in short pronunci), ka-ta-bū (modern standard arab) 'thei wrote' = ka-ta-bu (dialect), ka-ta-bū-h(u) (modern standard arab) 'thei wrote it' = ka-ta-bū (dialect), ka-ta-ba-tā (modern standard arab) 'thei (dual, fem) wrote', ka-tab-tu (modern standard arab) 'i wrote' = ka-tabt (short form or dialect). doubl conson count as two conson: ma-jal-la-(tan) 'magazin', ma-ḥall(-un) "place".

these rule mai result in differ stress syllabl when final case end ar pronounc, vs. the normal situat where thei ar not pronounc, as in the abov exampl of mak-ta-ba-tun 'librari' in full pronunci, but mak-ta-ba(-tun) 'librari' in short pronunci.

the restrict on final long vowel doe not appli to the spoken dialect, where origin final long vowel have been shorten and secondari final long vowel have arisen from loss of origin final -hu/hi.

some dialect have differ stress rule. in the cairo (egyptian arab) dialect a heavi syllabl mai not carri stress more than two syllabl from the end of a word, henc mad-ra-sah 'school', qā-hi-rah 'cairo'. thi also affect the wai that modern standard arab is pronounc in egypt. in the arab of sanaa, stress is often retract: bai-tayn 'two hous', mā-sat-hum 'their tabl', ma-kā-tīb 'desk', zā-rat-ḥīn 'sometim', mad-ra-sat-hum 'their school'. (in thi dialect, onli syllabl with long vowel or diphthong ar consid heavi; in a two-syllabl word, the final syllabl can be stress onli if the preced syllabl is light; and in longer word, the final syllabl cannot be stress.)

level of pronunci
the final short vowel (e.g., the case end -a -i -u and mood end -u -a) ar often not pronounc in thi languag, despit form part of the formal paradigm of noun and verb. the follow level of pronunci exist:

full pronunci with pausa
thi is the most formal level actual us in speech. all end ar pronounc as written, except at the end of an utter, where the follow chang occur:

final short vowel ar not pronounc. (but possibl an except is made for feminin plural -na and shorten vowel in the jussiv/imper of defect verb, e.g., irmi! 'throw!'".)
the entir indefinit noun end -in and -un (with nunat) ar left off. the end -an is left off of noun preced by a tāʾ marbūṭah ة (i.e. the -t in the end -at- that typic mark feminin noun), but pronounc as -ā in other noun (henc it write in thi fashion in the arab script).
the tāʼ marbūṭah itself (typic of feminin noun) is pronounc as h. (at least, thi is the case in extrem formal pronunci, e.g., some quran recit. in practic, thi h is usual omit.)
formal short pronunci
thi is a formal level of pronunci sometim seen. it is somewhat like pronounc all word as if thei were in pausal posit (with influenc from the colloqui varieti). the follow chang occur:

most final short vowel ar not pronounc. howev, the follow short vowel ar pronounc:
feminin plural -na
shorten vowel in the jussiv/imper of defect verb, e.g., irmi! 'throw!'
second-person singular feminin past-tens -ti and likewis anti 'you (fem. sg.)'
sometim, first-person singular past-tens -tu
sometim, second-person masculin past-tens -ta and likewis anta 'you (masc. sg.)'
final -a in certain short word, e.g., laysa 'is not', sawfa (futur-tens marker)
the nunat end -an -in -un ar not pronounc. howev, thei ar pronounc in adverbi accus format, e.g., taqrīban تَقْرِيبًا 'almost, approxim', ʻādatan عَادَةً 'usual'.
the tāʾ marbūṭah end ة is unpronounc, except in construct state noun, where it sound as t (and in adverbi accus construct, e.g., ʻādatan عَادَةً 'usual', where the entir -tan is pronounc).
the masculin singular nisbah end -iyi is actual pronounc -ī and is unstress (but plural and feminin singular form, i.e. when follow by a suffix, still sound as -iyi-).
full end (includ case end) occur when a clitic object or possess suffix is ad (e.g., -nā 'us/our').
inform short pronunci
thi is the pronunci us by speaker of modern standard arab in extemporan speech, i.e. when produc new sentenc rather than simpli read a prepar text. it is similar to formal short pronunci except that the rule for drop final vowel appli even when a clitic suffix is ad. basic, short-vowel case and mood end ar never pronounc and certain other chang occur that echo the correspond colloqui pronunci. specif:

all the rule for formal short pronunci appli, except as follow.
the past tens singular end written formal as -tu -ta -ti ar pronounc -t -t -ti. but masculin ʾanta is pronounc in full.
unlik in formal short pronunci, the rule for drop or modifi final end ar also appli when a clitic object or possess suffix is ad (e.g., -nā 'us/our'). if thi produc a sequenc of three conson, then on of the follow happen, depend on the speaker's nativ colloqui varieti:
a short vowel (e.g., -i- or -ǝ-) is consist ad, either between the second and third or the first and second conson.
or, a short vowel is ad onli if an otherwis unpronounc sequenc occur, typic due to a violat of the sonor hierarchi (e.g., -rtn- is pronounc as a three-conson cluster, but -trn- need to be broken up).
or, a short vowel is never ad, but conson like r l m n occur between two other conson will be pronounc as a syllab conson (as in the english word "butter bottl bottom button").
when a doubl conson occur befor anoth conson (or final), it is often shorten to a singl conson rather than a vowel ad. (howev, moroccan arab never shorten doubl conson or insert short vowel to break up cluster, instead toler arbitrari-length seri of arbitrari conson and henc moroccan arab speaker ar like to follow the same rule in their pronunci of modern standard arab.)
the clitic suffix themselv tend also to be chang, in a wai that avoid mani possibl occurr of three-conson cluster. in particular, -ka -ki -hu gener sound as -ak -ik -uh.
final long vowel ar often shorten, merg with ani short vowel that remain.
depend on the level of formal, the speaker's educ level, etc., variou grammat chang mai occur in wai that echo the colloqui variant:
ani remain case end (e.g. masculin plural nomin -ūn vs. obliqu -īn) will be level, with the obliqu form us everywher. (howev, in word like ab 'father' and akh 'brother' with special long-vowel case end in the construct state, the nomin is us everywher, henc abū 'father of', akhū 'brother of'.)
feminin plural end in verb and clitic suffix will often drop out, with the masculin plural end us instead. if the speaker's nativ varieti ha feminin plural end, thei mai be preserv, but will often be modifi in the direct of the form us in the speaker's nativ varieti, e.g. -an instead of -na.
dual end will often drop out except on noun and then us onli for emphasi (similar to their us in the colloqui varieti); elsewher, the plural end ar us (or feminin singular, if appropri).

as mention abov, mani spoken dialect have a process of emphasi spread, where the "emphasi" (pharyng) of emphat conson spread forward and back through adjac syllabl, pharyng all nearbi conson and trigger the back allophon [ɑ(ː)] in all nearbi low vowel. the extent of emphasi spread vari. for exampl, in moroccan arab, it spread as far as the first full vowel (i.e. sound deriv from a long vowel or diphthong) on either side; in mani levantin dialect, it spread indefinit, but is block by ani /j/ or /ʃ/; while in egyptian arab, it usual spread throughout the entir word, includ prefix and suffix. in moroccan arab, /i u/ also have emphat allophon [e~ɛ] and [o~ɔ], respect.

unstress short vowel, especi /i u/, ar delet in mani context. mani sporad exampl of short vowel chang have occur (especi /a/→/i/ and interchang /i/↔/u/). most levantin dialect merg short /i u/ into /ə/ in most context (all except directli befor a singl final conson). in moroccan arab, on the other hand, short /u/ trigger labial of nearbi conson (especi velar conson and uvular conson), and then short /a i u/ all merg into /ə/, which is delet in mani context. (the labial plu /ə/ is sometim interpret as an underli phonem /ŭ/.) thi essenti caus the wholesal loss of the short-long vowel distinct, with the origin long vowel /aː iː uː/ remain as half-long [aˑ iˑ uˑ], phonem /a i u/, which ar us to repres both short and long vowel in borrow from literari arab.

most spoken dialect have monophthong origin /aj aw/ to /eː oː/ in most circumst, includ adjac to emphat conson, while keep them as the origin diphthong in other e.g. مَوْعِد‎ /mawʕid/. in most of the moroccan, algerian and tunisian (except sahel and southeastern) arab dialect, thei have subsequ merg into origin /iː uː/.

conson
in most dialect, there mai be more or fewer phonem than those list in the chart abov. for exampl, [g] is consid a nativ phonem in most arab dialect except in levantin dialect like syrian or lebanes where ج‎ is pronounc [ʒ] and ق‎ is pronounc [ʔ]. [d͡ʒ] or [ʒ] (ج‎) is consid a nativ phonem in most dialect except in egyptian and a number of yemeni and omani dialect where ج‎ is pronounc [g]. [zˤ] or [ðˤ] and [dˤ] ar distinguish in the dialect of egypt, sudan, the levant and the hejaz, but thei have merg as [ðˤ] in most dialect of the arabian peninsula, iraq and tunisia and have merg as [dˤ] in morocco and algeria. the usag of non-nativ [p] پ‎ and [v] ڤ‎ depend on the usag of each speaker but thei might be more preval in some dialect than other. the iraqi and gulf arab also ha the sound [t͡ʃ] and write it and [ɡ] with the persian letter چ and گ, as in گوجة gawjah "plum"; چمة chimah "truffl".

earli in the expans of arab, the separ emphat phonem [ɮˤ] and [ðˤ] coalesc into a singl phonem [ðˤ]. mani dialect (such as egyptian, levantin, and much of the maghreb) subsequ lost interdent fric, convert [θ ð ðˤ] into [t d dˤ]. most dialect borrow "learn" word from the standard languag us the same pronunci as for inherit word, but some dialect without interdent fric (particularli in egypt and the levant) render origin [θ ð ðˤ dˤ] in borrow word as [s z zˤ dˤ].

anoth kei distinguish mark of arab dialect is how thei render the origin velar and uvular plosiv /q/, /d͡ʒ/ (proto-semit /ɡ/), and /k/:

ق‎ /q/ retain it origin pronunci in wide scatter region such as yemen, morocco, and urban area of the maghreb. it is pronounc as a glottal stop [ʔ] in sever prestig dialect, such as those spoken in cairo, beirut and damascu. but it is render as a voic velar plosiv [ɡ] in persian gulf, upper egypt, part of the maghreb, and less urban part of the levant (e.g. jordan). in iraqi arab it sometim retain it origin pronunci and is sometim render as a voic velar plosiv, depend on the word. some tradition christian villag in rural area of the levant render the sound as [k], as do shiʻi bahraini. in some gulf dialect, it is palat to [d͡ʒ] or [ʒ]. it is pronounc as a voic uvular constrict [ʁ] in sudanes arab. mani dialect with a modifi pronunci for /q/ maintain the [q] pronunci in certain word (often with religi or educ overton) borrow from the classic languag.
ج‎ /d͡ʒ/ is pronounc as an affric in iraq and much of the arabian peninsula but is pronounc [ɡ] in most of north egypt and part of yemen and oman, [ʒ] in morocco, tunisia, and the levant, and [j], [i̠] in most word in much of the persian gulf.
ك‎ /k/ usual retain it origin pronunci but is palat to /t͡ʃ/ in mani word in israel and the palestinian territori, iraq, and countri in the eastern part of the arabian peninsula. often a distinct is made between the suffix /-ak/ ('you', masc.) and /-ik/ ('you', fem.), which becom /-ak/ and /-it͡ʃ/, respect. in sana'a, omani, and bahrani /-ik/ is pronounc /-iʃ/.
pharyng of the emphat conson tend to weaken in mani of the spoken varieti, and to spread from emphat conson to nearbi sound. in addit, the "emphat" allophon [ɑ] automat trigger pharyng of adjac sound in mani dialect. as a result, it mai difficult or imposs to determin whether a given coron conson is phonem emphat or not, especi in dialect with long-distanc emphasi spread. (a notabl except is the sound /t/ vs. /tˤ/ in moroccan arab, becaus the former is pronounc as an affric [t͡s] but the latter is not.)

grammar

exampl of how the arab root and form system work
main articl: arab grammar
literari arab
main articl: modern standard arab
as in other semit languag, arab ha a complex and unusu morpholog (i.e. method of construct word from a basic root). arab ha a nonconcaten "root-and-pattern" morpholog: a root consist of a set of bare conson (usual three), which ar fit into a discontinu pattern to form word. for exampl, the word for 'i wrote' is construct by combin the root k-t-b 'write' with the pattern -a-a-tu 'i xed' to form katabtu 'i wrote'. other verb mean 'i xed' will typic have the same pattern but with differ conson, e.g. qaraʼtu 'i read', akaltu 'i at', dhahabtu 'i went', although other pattern ar possibl (e.g. sharibtu 'i drank', qultu 'i said', takallamtu 'i spoke', where the subpattern us to signal the past tens mai chang but the suffix -tu is alwai us).

from a singl root k-t-b, numer word can be form by appli differ pattern:

كَتَبْتُ katabtu 'i wrote'
كَتَّبْتُ kattabtu 'i had (someth) written'
كَاتَبْتُ kātabtu 'i correspond (with someon)'
أَكْتَبْتُ 'aktabtu 'i dictat'
اِكْتَتَبْتُ iktatabtu 'i subscrib'
تَكَاتَبْنَا takātabnā 'we correspond with each other'
أَكْتُبُ 'aktubu 'i write'
أُكَتِّبُ 'ukattibu 'i have (someth) written'
أُكَاتِبُ 'ukātibu 'i correspond (with someon)'
أُكْتِبُ 'uktibu 'i dictat'
أَكْتَتِبُ 'aktatibu 'i subscrib'
نَتَكَتِبُ natakātabu 'we correspond each other'
كُتِبَ kutiba 'it wa written'
أُكْتِبَ 'uktiba 'it wa dictat'
مَكْتُوبٌ maktūbun 'written'
مُكْتَبٌ muktabun 'dictat'
كِتَابٌ kitābun 'book'
كُتُبٌ kutubun 'book'
كَاتِبٌ kātibun 'writer'
كُتَّابٌ kuttābun 'writer'
مَكْتَبٌ maktabun 'desk, offic'
مَكْتَبَةٌ maktabatun 'librari, bookshop'
etc.
noun and adject
noun in literari arab have three grammat case (nomin, accus, and genit [also us when the noun is govern by a preposit]); three number (singular, dual and plural); two gender (masculin and feminin); and three "state" (indefinit, definit, and construct). the case of singular noun (other than those that end in long ā) ar indic by suffix short vowel (/-u/ for nomin, /-a/ for accus, /-i/ for genit).

the feminin singular is often mark by ـَة /-at/, which is pronounc as /-ah/ befor a paus. plural is indic either through end (the sound plural) or intern modif (the broken plural). definit noun includ all proper noun, all noun in "construct state" and all noun which ar prefix by the definit articl اَلْـ /al-/. indefinit singular noun (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-mark vowel, give /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also refer to as nunat or tanwīn).

adject in literari arab ar mark for case, number, gender and state, as for noun. howev, the plural of all non-human noun is alwai combin with a singular feminin adject, which take the ـَة /-at/ suffix.

pronoun in literari arab ar mark for person, number and gender. there ar two varieti, independ pronoun and enclit. enclit pronoun ar attach to the end of a verb, noun or preposit and indic verbal and preposit object or possess of noun. the first-person singular pronoun ha a differ enclit form us for verb (ـنِي /-nī/) and for noun or preposit (ـِي /-ī/ after conson, ـيَ /-ya/ after vowel).

noun, verb, pronoun and adject agre with each other in all respect. howev, non-human plural noun ar grammat consid to be feminin singular. furthermor, a verb in a verb-initi sentenc is mark as singular regardless of it semant number when the subject of the verb is explicitli mention as a noun. numer between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement, in that grammat masculin numer have feminin mark and vice versa.

verb
further inform: arab verb
verb in literari arab ar mark for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. thei ar conjug in two major paradigm (past and non-past); two voic (activ and passiv); and six mood (indic, imper, subjunct, jussiv, shorter energet and longer energet), the fifth and sixth mood, the energet, exist onli in classic arab but not in msa.[91] there ar also two participl (activ and passiv) and a verbal noun, but no infinit.

the past and non-past paradigm ar sometim also term perfect and imperfect, indic the fact that thei actual repres a combin of tens and aspect. the mood other than the indic occur onli in the non-past, and the futur tens is signal by prefix سَـ sa- or سَوْفَ sawfa onto the non-past. the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem (e.g., past كَتَبـkatab- vs. non-past ـكْتُبـ -ktub-), and also us complet differ set of affix for indic person, number and gender: in the past, the person, number and gender ar fuse into a singl suffix morphem, while in the non-past, a combin of prefix (primarili encod person) and suffix (primarili encod gender and number) ar us. the passiv voic us the same person/number/gender affix but chang the vowel of the stem.

the follow show a paradigm of a regular arab verb, كَتَبَ kataba 'to write'. in modern standard, the energet mood (in either long or short form, which have the same mean) is almost never us.

deriv
like other semit languag, and unlik most other languag, arab make much more us of nonconcaten morpholog (appli mani templat appli root) to deriv word than ad prefix or suffix to word.

for verb, a given root can occur in mani differ deriv verb stem (of which there ar about fifteen), each with on or more characterist mean and each with it own templat for the past and non-past stem, activ and passiv participl, and verbal noun. these ar refer to by western scholar as "form i", "form ii", and so on through "form xv" (although form xi to xv ar rare). these stem encod grammat function such as the caus, intens and reflex. stem share the same root conson repres separ verb, albeit often semant relat, and each is the basi for it own conjug paradigm. as a result, these deriv stem ar part of the system of deriv morpholog, not part of the inflect system.

most of these form ar exclus classic arab

x	istaktaba	'he ask (someon) to write'	yastaktibu	'he ask (someon) to write'
form ii is sometim us to creat transit denomin verb (verb built from noun); form v is the equival us for intransit denomin.

the associ participl and verbal noun of a verb ar the primari mean of form new lexic noun in arab. thi is similar to the process by which, for exampl, the english gerund "meet" (similar to a verbal noun) ha turn into a noun refer to a particular type of social, often work-relat event where peopl gather togeth to have a "discuss" (anoth lexic verbal noun). anoth fairli common mean of form noun is through on of a limit number of pattern that can be appli directli to root, such as the "noun of locat" in ma- (e.g. maktab 'desk, offic' < k-t-b 'write', maṭbakh 'kitchen' < ṭ-b-kh 'cook').

the onli three genuin suffix ar as follow:

the feminin suffix -ah; various deriv term for women from relat term for men, or more gener term along the same line as the correspond masculin, e.g. maktabah 'librari' (also a write-relat place, but differ from maktab, as abov).
the nisbah suffix -iyi-. thi suffix is extrem product, and form adject mean "relat to x". it correspond to english adject in -ic, -al, -an, -y, -ist, etc.
the feminin nisbah suffix -iyyah. thi is form by ad the feminin suffix -ah onto nisba adject to form abstract noun. for exampl, from the basic root sh-r-k 'share' can be deriv the form viii verb ishtaraka 'to cooper, particip', and in turn it verbal noun ishtirāk 'cooper, particip' can be form. thi in turn can be made into a nisbah adject ishtirākī 'socialist', from which an abstract noun ishtirākiyyah 'social' can be deriv. other recent format ar jumhūriyyah 'republ' (lit. "public-ness", < jumhūr 'multitud, gener public'), and the gaddafi-specif variat jamāhīriyyah 'peopl's republ' (lit. "mass-ness", < jamāhīr 'the mass', pl. of jumhūr, as abov).
colloqui varieti
main articl: varieti of arab
the spoken dialect have lost the case distinct and make onli limit us of the dual (it occur onli on noun and it us is no longer requir in all circumst). thei have lost the mood distinct other than imper, but mani have sinc gain new mood through the us of prefix (most often /bi-/ for indic vs. unmark subjunct). thei have also mostli lost the indefinit "nunat" and the intern passiv.

arab calligraphi written by a malai muslim in malaysia. the calligraph is make a rough draft.
the arab alphabet deriv from the arama through nabatean, to which it bear a loos resembl like that of coptic or cyril script to greek script. tradition, there were sever differ between the western (north african) and middl eastern version of the alphabet—in particular, the faʼ had a dot underneath and qaf a singl dot abov in the maghreb, and the order of the letter wa slightli differ (at least when thei were us as numer).

howev, the old maghrebi variant ha been abandon except for calligraph purpos in the maghreb itself, and remain in us mainli in the quran school (zaouia) of west africa. arab, like all other semit languag (except for the latin-written maltes, and the languag with the ge'ez script), is written from right to left. there ar sever style of script such as thuluth, muhaqqaq, tawqi, rayhan and notabl naskh, which is us in print and by comput, and ruqʻah, which is commonli us for correspond.[92][93]

origin arab wa made up of onli rasm without diacrit mark[94] later diacrit point (which in arab ar refer to as nuqaṯ) were ad (which allow reader to distinguish between letter such as b, t, th, n and y). final sign known as tashkil were us for short vowel known as harakat and other us such as final postnas or long vowel.

after khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi final fix the arab script around 786, mani style were develop, both for the write down of the quran and other book, and for inscript on monument as decor.

arab calligraphi ha not fallen out of us as calligraphi ha in the western world, and is still consid by arab as a major art form; calligraph ar held in great esteem. be cursiv by natur, unlik the latin script, arab script is us to write down a vers of the quran, a hadith, or simpli a proverb. the composit is often abstract, but sometim the write is shape into an actual form such as that of an anim. on of the current master of the genr is hassan massoudi.

in modern time the intrins calligraph natur of the written arab form is haunt by the thought that a typograph approach to the languag, necessari for digit unif, will not alwai accur maintain mean convei through calligraphi.[95]

there ar a number of differ standard for the roman of arab, i.e. method of accur and effici repres arab with the latin script. there ar variou conflict motiv involv, which lead to multipl system. some ar interest in transliter, i.e. repres the spell of arab, while other focu on transcript, i.e. repres the pronunci of arab. (thei differ in that, for exampl, the same letter ي‎ is us to repres both a conson, as in "you" or "yet", and a vowel, as in "me" or "eat".) some system, e.g. for scholarli us, ar intend to accur and unambigu repres the phonem of arab, gener make the phonet more explicit than the origin word in the arab script. these system ar heavili reliant on diacrit mark such as "š" for the sound equival written sh in english. other system (e.g. the bahá'í orthographi) ar intend to help reader who ar neither arab speaker nor linguist with intuit pronunci of arab name and phrase.[citat need] these less "scientif" system tend to avoid diacrit and us digraph (like sh and kh). these ar usual simpler to read, but sacrific the definit of the scientif system, and mai lead to ambigu, e.g. whether to interpret sh as a singl sound, as in gash, or a combin of two sound, as in gashous. the ala-lc roman solv thi problem by separ the two sound with a prime symbol ( ′ ); e.g., as′hal 'easier'.

dure the last few decad and especi sinc the 1990s, western-invent text commun technolog have becom preval in the arab world, such as person comput, the world wide web, email, bulletin board system, irc, instant messag and mobil phone text messag. most of these technolog origin had the abil to commun us the latin script onli, and some of them still do not have the arab script as an option featur. as a result, arab speak user commun in these technolog by transliter the arab text us the latin script, sometim known as im arab.

to handl those arab letter that cannot be accur repres us the latin script, numer and other charact were appropri. for exampl, the numer "3" mai be us to repres the arab letter ⟨ع‎⟩. there is no univers name for thi type of transliter, but some have name it arab chat alphabet. other system of transliter exist, such as us dot or capit to repres the "emphat" counterpart of certain conson. for instanc, us capit, the letter ⟨د‎⟩, mai be repres by d. it emphat counterpart, ⟨ض‎⟩, mai be written as d.

numer
in most of present-dai north africa, the western arab numer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) ar us. howev, in egypt and arab-speak countri to the east of it, the eastern arab numer (٠‎ – ١‎ – ٢‎ – ٣‎ – ٤‎ – ٥‎ – ٦‎ – ٧‎ – ٨‎ – ٩‎) ar in us. when repres a number in arab, the lowest-valu posit is place on the right, so the order of posit is the same as in left-to-right script. sequenc of digit such as telephon number ar read from left to right, but number ar spoken in the tradit arab fashion, with unit and ten revers from the modern english usag. for exampl, 24 is said "four and twenti" just like in the german languag (vierundzwanzig) and classic hebrew, and 1975 is said "a thousand and nine-hundr and five and seventi" or, more eloqu, "a thousand and nine-hundr five seventi"
